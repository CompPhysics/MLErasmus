## Introduction

Probability theory and statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one trillion web pages; more than one
hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, amounting to years of content every
day; the genomes of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion  base pairs, have
been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis,
which is exactly what machine learning aims at providing. 

## Learning outcomes

This course aims at giving you insights and knowledge about  many of the central algorithms used in Data Analysis and Machine Learning.  The course is project based and through  various numerical projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. Both supervised and unsupervised methods will be covered. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying different  systems where Machine Learning is applied to, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

- Learn about basic data analysis, statistical analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo sampling, data optimization and machine learning;
- Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
- Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
- Understand linear methods for regression and classification, from ordinary least squares, via Lasso and Ridge to Logistic regression;
- Learn about various neural networks and deep  learning methods for supervised and unsupervised learning;
- Learn about about decision trees and random forests
- Learn about support vector machines and kernel transformations
- Reduction of data sets, from PCA to clustering, supervised and unsupervised methods
- Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.  

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge in programming and mathematics, with an emphasis on
linear algebra. Knowledge of Python or/and C++ as programming
languages is strongly recommended and experience with Jupiter notebook
is recommended.


## The course has two central parts

1. Statistical analysis and optimization of data
2. Machine learning

These topics will be scattered thorughout the course and may not  necessarily be taught separately. Rather, we will often take an approach (during the lectures and project/exercise sessions where say elements from statistical data analysis are mixed with specific Machine Learning algorithms. 

### Statistical analysis and optimization of data

The following topics will be covered
- Basic concepts, expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
- Simpler models, binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, simple and multivariate normal distributions;
- Central elements of Bayesian statistics and modeling;
- Gradient methods for data optimization
- Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm;
- Linear methods for regression and classification;
- Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
- Practical optimization using Singular-value decomposition and least squares for parameterizing data.

### Machine learning

The following topics will be covered
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression;
- Neural networks and deep learning;
- Decisions trees, random forests, boosting and bagging
- Support vector machines
- Dimensionality reduction, from PCA to cluster models

Hands-one demonstrations, exercises and projects aim at deepining your understanding of these topics.

Computational aspects play a central role and you are
expected to work on numerical examples and projects which illustrate
the theory and methods. We recommend strongly to form small project groups of 2-3 participants. 


## Practicalities

1. Lectures are in the morning, from 9am-12pm.
2. Four hours of laboratory sessions for work on computational projects, from 2pm to 6pm;
3. Lectures and lab sessions will all be at GANIL, starting January 20 at 9am. 
4. Grading scale: Grades are awarded on a scale from A to F, where A is the best grade and F is a fail. We are aiming at having two projects to be handed in. These will graded and should be finalized not later than two weeks after the course is over. Both projects count 50% each of the final grade. We plan to make the grades available not later than March 1, hopefully the grades will be available before that.
