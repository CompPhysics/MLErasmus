!bwarning
The PDF files are based on LaTeX and have seldom technical
failures that cannot be easily corrected.
The HTML-based files, called ``HTML'' and ``ipynb'' below, apply MathJax
for rendering LaTeX formulas and sometimes this technology gives rise
to unexpected failures (e.g.,
incorrect rendering in a web page despite correct LaTeX syntax in the
formula). Consult the corresponding PDF
files if you find missing or incorrectly rendered
formulas in HTML or ipython notebook files.
