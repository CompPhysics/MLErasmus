===== Course content =====

Probability theory and statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one trillion web pages; more than one
hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, amounting to 10 years of content every
day; the genomes of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of $3.8\times 10^9$ base pairs, have
been sequenced by various labs and so on.
This deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis,
which is exactly what machine
learning provides. In this course the approach is to define machine learning as a set of methods that can
automatically detect patterns in data, and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future
data, or to perform other kinds of decision making under uncertainty. Since many of these problems can be studied using
tools of probability theory, the aim of this course is to expose you to central methods in probability theory linked with machine learning.

This course covers thus topics like Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains, Bayesian statistics, error estimates, various linear methods, optimization of data and error analysis and central algorithms in machine learning.
The course has several numerical projects and numerical exercises that are meant to illustrate the theory.



===== Learning outcomes =====

The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods
essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The course is project based and through the various projects, normally three, the students will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. The students will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

* Learn about basic data analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods, data optimization and machine learning;
* Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
* Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
* Have a basic knowledge of Bayesian statistics  and learning and common distributions;
* Gain knowledge of central aspects of Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Gibbs samplers and their possible applications, from numerical integration to simulation of stock markets;
* Understand linear methods for regression and classification;
* Learn about neural network, genetic algorithms and Boltzmann machines;
* Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and students are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++. 



===== Prerequisites =====
