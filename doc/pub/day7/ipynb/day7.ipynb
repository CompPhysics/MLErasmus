    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",

    "A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:\n",

    "* **INPUT** ($32\\times 32 \\times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CONV** (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\\times 32\\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RELU** layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\\times 32\\times 12]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **POOL** (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\\times 16\\times 12]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FC** (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\\times 1\\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume."
