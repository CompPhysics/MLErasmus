    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last\n",
    "decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition\n",
    "tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success\n",
    "of deep learning methods. The success in for example image\n",
    "classifications have made them a central tool for most machine\n",
    "learning practitioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.\n",
    "They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and\n",
    "biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and\n",
    "optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still\n",
    "expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image\n",
    "pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a\n",
    "loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer\n",
    "and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural\n",
    "Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference? **CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that\n",
    "the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties\n",
    "into the architecture. These then make the forward function more\n",
    "efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in\n",
    "the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide only a superficial overview, for the more interested, we recommend highly the course\n",
    "[IN5400 – Machine Learning for Image Analysis](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/index-eng.html)\n",
    "and the slides of [CS231](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks vs CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are defined as **affine transformations**, that is \n",
    "a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an\n",
    "output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result\n",
    "through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an\n",
    "image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their\n",
    "dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector\n",
    "before the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic\n",
    "structure. More formally, they share these important properties:\n",
    "* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .\n",
    "\n",
    "* They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).\n",
    "\n",
    "* One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in\n",
    "fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information\n",
    "is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of\n",
    "the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and\n",
    "speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is\n",
    "where discrete convolutions come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of\n",
    "ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output\n",
    "unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations\n",
    "in the input).\n",

    "## Regular NNs don’t scale well to full images\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider\n",
    "an image of size $32\\times 32\\times 3$ (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a\n",
    "single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular\n",

    "size, say $200\\times 200\\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have \n",
    "$200\\times 200\\times 3 = 120,000$ weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could have\n",
    "several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,\n",
    "this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters\n",

    "A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN\n",

    "* **INPUT** ($32\\times 32 \\times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CONV** (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\\times 32\\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RELU** layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\\times 32\\times 12]$).\n",

    "* **POOL** (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\\times 16\\times 12]$.\n",

    "* **FC** (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\\times 1\\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.\n",

    "## Transforming images\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original\n",

    "Observe that some layers contain\n",
    "parameters and other don’t. In particular, the CNN layers perform\n",
    "transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the\n",
    "input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of\n",
    "the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a\n",
    "fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained\n",
