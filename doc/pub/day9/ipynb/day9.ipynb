    "\n",
    "We will discuss in more detail decision trees, voting and bagging methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decision trees we have Geron's chapter 6 which covers decision trees while ensemble models, voting and bagging are discussed in chapter 7. See also lecture from [STK-IN4300, lecture 7](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK-IN4300/h20/slides/lecture_7.pdf). Chapter 9.2 of Hastie et al contains also a good discussion.\n",

    "## Decision trees, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We start here with the most basic algorithm, the so-called decision\n",
    "tree. With this basic algorithm we can in turn build more complex\n",
    "networks, spanning from homogeneous and heterogenous forests (bagging,\n",
    "random forests and more) to one of the most popular supervised\n",
    "algorithms nowadays, the extreme gradient boosting, or just\n",
    "XGBoost. But let us start with the simplest possible ingredient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms used for both,\n",
    "classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of decision trees\n",
    "is to find those descriptive features which contain the most\n",
    "**information** regarding the target feature and then split the dataset\n",
    "along the values of these features such that the target feature values\n",
    "for the resulting underlying datasets are as pure as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptive features which reproduce best the target/output features are normally  said\n",
    "to be the most informative ones. The process of finding the **most\n",
    "informative** feature is done until we accomplish a stopping criteria\n",
    "where we then finally end up in so called **leaf nodes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics of a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is typically divided into a **root node**, the **interior nodes**,\n",
    "and the final **leaf nodes** or just **leaves**. These entities are then connected by so-called **branches**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf nodes\n",
    "contain the predictions we will make for new query instances presented\n",
    "to our trained model. This is possible since the model has \n",
    "learned the underlying structure of the training data and hence can,\n",
    "given some assumptions, make predictions about the target feature value\n",
    "(class) of unseen query instances.\n",

    "## How do we set it up?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simplified terms, the process of training a decision tree and\n",
    "predicting the target features of query instances is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Present a dataset containing of a number of training instances characterized by a number of descriptive features and a target feature\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train the decision tree model by continuously splitting the target feature along the values of the descriptive features using a measure of information gain during the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Grow the tree until we accomplish a stopping criteria create leaf nodes which represent the *predictions* we want to make for new query instances\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Show query instances to the tree and run down the tree until we arrive at leaf nodes\n",

    "## A Classification Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification tree is very similar to a regression tree, except\n",
    "that it is used to predict a qualitative response rather than a\n",
    "quantitative one. Recall that for a regression tree, the predicted\n",
    "response for an observation is given by the mean response of the\n",
    "training observations that belong to the same terminal node. In\n",
    "contrast, for a classification tree, we predict that each observation\n",
    "belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations\n",
    "in the region to which it belongs. In interpreting the results of a\n",
    "classification tree, we are often interested not only in the class\n",
    "prediction corresponding to a particular terminal node region, but\n",
    "also in the class proportions among the training observations that\n",
    "fall into that region.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Growing a classification tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of growing a\n",
    "classification tree is quite similar to the task of growing a\n",
    "regression tree. Just as in the regression setting, we use recursive\n",
    "binary splitting to grow a classification tree. However, in the\n",
    "classification setting, the MSE cannot be used as a criterion for making\n",
    "the binary splits.  A natural alternative to MSE is the **classification\n",
    "error rate**. Since we plan to assign an observation in a given region\n",
    "to the most commonly occurring error rate class of training\n",
    "observations in that region, the classification error rate is simply\n",
    "the fraction of the training observations in that region that do not\n",
    "belong to the most common class. \n",
    "\n",
    "When building a classification tree, either the Gini index or the\n",
    "entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular\n",
    "split, since these two approaches are more sensitive to node purity\n",

    "## Pros and cons of trees, pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* White box, easy to interpret model. Some people believe that decision trees more closely mirror human decision-making than do the regression and classification approaches discussed earlier (think of support vector machines)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trees are very easy to explain to people. In fact, they are even easier to explain than linear regression!\n",
    "\n",
    "* No feature normalization needed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree models can handle both continuous and categorical data (Classification and Regression Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can model nonlinear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can model interactions between the different descriptive features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trees can be displayed graphically, and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert (especially if they are small)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unfortunately, trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "* If continuous features are used the tree may become quite large and hence less interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision trees are prone to overfit the training data and hence do not well generalize the data if no stopping criteria or improvements like pruning, boosting or bagging are implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small changes in the data may lead to a completely different tree. This issue can be addressed by using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting or random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unbalanced datasets where some target feature values occur much more frequently than others may lead to biased trees since the frequently occurring feature values are preferred over the less frequently occurring ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of features is relatively large (high dimensional) and the number of instances is relatively low, the tree might overfit the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features with many levels may be preferred over features with less levels since for them it is *more easy* to split the dataset such that the sub datasets only contain pure target feature values. This issue can be addressed by preferring for instance the information gain ratio as splitting criteria over information gain\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by aggregating many decision trees, using methods like\n",
    "bagging, random forests, and boosting, the predictive performance of\n",
    "trees can be substantially improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensemble Methods: From a Single Tree to Many Trees and Extreme Boosting, Meet the Jungle of Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above and seen in many of the examples discussed here about\n",
    "a single decision tree, we often end up overfitting our training\n",
    "data. This normally means that we have a high variance. Can we reduce\n",
    "the variance of a statistical learning method?\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to a set of different methods that can combine different\n",
    "machine learning algorithms or just use one of them to construct\n",
    "forests and jungles of trees, homogeneous ones or heterogenous\n",
    "ones. These methods are recognized by different names which we will\n",

    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "The **plain** decision trees suffer from high\n",
    "variance. This means that if we split the training data into two parts\n",
    "at random, and fit a decision tree to both halves, the results that we\n",
    "get could be quite different. In contrast, a procedure with low\n",
    "variance will yield similar results if applied repeatedly to distinct\n",
    "data sets; linear regression tends to have low variance, if the ratio\n",
    "of $n$ to $p$ is moderately large. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap aggregation**, or just **bagging**, is a\n",
    "general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical\n",
    "learning method. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging typically results in improved accuracy\n",
    "over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be\n",
    "difficult to interpret the resulting model. Recall that one of the\n",
    "advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted\n",
    "diagram that results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer\n",
    "possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure\n",
    "using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are\n",
    "most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction\n",
    "accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection\n",
    "of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single\n",
    "tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each\n",
    "predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini\n",
    "index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging\n",
    "regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is\n",
    "decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible\n",
    "trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in\n",
    "the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total\n",
    "amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given\n",
    "predictor, averaged over all $B$ trees.\n",
