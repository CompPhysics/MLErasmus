    "## Types of Machine Learning, a repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Other unsupervised learning algortihms, here Boltzmann machines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Boltzmann machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a lot of attention lately. \n",
    "One of the major reasons is that they can be stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture complicated statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous data that are common to natural images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An intermediate step, the Hopfield network and links to the Ising and Potts models\n",
    "\n",
    "More material on Hopfield networks will come here later. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief review on Markov Chains, Metropolis and Gibbs sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start with a PDF $w(x_0,t_0)$  and we want to understand how the system evolves with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to reach a situation where after a given number of time steps we obtain a steady state. This means that the system reaches its most likely state (equilibrium situation)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our PDF is normally a multidimensional object whose normalization constant is impossible to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analytical calculations from $w(x,t)$ are not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To sample directly from from $w(x,t)$ is not possible/difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The transition probability $W$ is also not  known.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can we establish that we have reached a steady state?   Sounds impossible!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Markov chain Monte Carlo**\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- !split  -->\n",
    "## Brownian motion and Markov processes\n",
    "A Markov process is a random walk with a selected probability for making a\n",
    "move. The new move is independent of the previous history of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov process is used repeatedly in Monte Carlo simulations in order to generate\n",
    "new random states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for choosing a Markov process is that when it is run for a\n",
    "long enough time starting with a random state, we will eventually reach the most likely state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, this means that after a certain number of Markov processes\n",
    "we reach an equilibrium distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mimicks the way a real system reaches\n",
    "its most likely state at a given temperature of the surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- !split  -->\n",
    "## Brownian motion and Markov processes, Ergodicity and Detailed balance\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach this distribution, the Markov process needs to obey two important conditions, that of\n",
    "**ergodicity** and **detailed balance**. These conditions impose then constraints on our algorithms\n",
    "for accepting or rejecting new random states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis algorithm discussed here\n",
    "abides to both these constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis algorithm is widely used in Monte Carlo\n",
    "simulations and the understanding of it rests within\n",
    "the interpretation of random walks and Markov processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- !split  -->\n",
    "## Brownian motion and Markov processes, jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "In a random walk one defines a mathematical entity called a **walker**, \n",
    "whose  attributes\n",
    "completely define the state of the system in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the system  can refer to any physical quantities,\n",
    "from the vibrational state of a molecule specified by a set of quantum numbers, \n",
    "to the brands of coffee in your favourite supermarket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The walker moves in an appropriate state space by a combination of \n",
    "deterministic and random displacements from its previous\n",
    "position.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of steps forms a **chain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- !split  -->\n",
    "## Brownian motion and Markov processes, sequence of ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Markov chains are intimately linked with the physical process of diffusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "* From a Markov chain we can then derive the conditions for detailed balance and ergodicity. These are the conditions needed for obtaining a steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The widely used algorithm for doing this is the so-called Metropolis algorithm, in its refined form the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the\n",

    "It turns into a Hopfield network if we choose deterministic rather\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A standard BM setup\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\\hat{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\\hat{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning\n",

This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.\n",

Our goal is to test the method on systems of moving particles. For the spin lattice systems it was natural to use a binary-binary RBM, with the nodes taking values of 1 and -1. For moving particles, on the other hand, we want the visible nodes to be continuous, representing position coordinates. Thus, we start by choosing a Gaussian-binary RBM, where the visible nodes are continuous and hidden nodes take on values of 0 or 1. If eventually we would like the hidden nodes to be continuous as well the rectified linear units seem like the most relevant choice.\n",
