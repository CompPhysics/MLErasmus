    "## Why Voting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind boosting, and voting as well can be phrased as follows:\n",
    "**Can a group of people somehow arrive at highly\n",
    "reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgement of the individual\n",
    "members?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to create a good classifier by combining several weak classifiers.\n",
    "**A weak classifier is a classifier which is able to produce results that are only slightly better than guessing at random.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic approach is to apply repeatedly (in boosting this is done in an iterative way) a weak classifier to modifications of the data.\n",
    "In voting we simply apply the law of large numbers while in boosting we give more weight to misclassified data in\n",
    "each iteration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees play an important role as our weak classifier. They serve as the basic method. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tossing coins\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case is a so-called voting ensemble. To illustrate this,\n",
    "think of yourself tossing coins with a biased outcome of 51 per cent\n",
    "for heads and 49% for tails. With only few tosses,\n",
    "you may not clearly see this distribution for heads and tails. However, after some\n",
    "thousands of tosses, there will be a clear majority of heads.  With 2000 tosses\n",
    "you should see approximately 1020 heads and 980 tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then state that the outcome is a clear majority of heads. If\n",
    "you do this ten thousand times, it is easy to see that there is a 97%\n",
    "likelihood of a majority of heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be to collect all polls before an\n",
    "election. Different polls may show different likelihoods for a\n",
    "candidate winning with say a majority  of the popular vote. The majority vote\n",
    "would then consist in many polls indicating that this candidate will\n",
    "actually win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example here shows how we can implement the coin tossing case,\n",
    "clealry demostrating that after some tosses we see the [law of large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)\n",
    "numbers kicking in.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on multi-layer nonlinear neural networks, deep learning can\n",
    "learn directly from raw data, automatically extract and abstract\n",
    "features from layer to layer, and then achieve the goal of regression,\n",
    "classification, or ranking. Deep learning has made breakthroughs in\n",
    "computer vision, speech processing and natural language, and reached\n",
    "or even surpassed human level. The success of deep learning is mainly\n",
    "due to the three factors: big data, big model, and big computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few decades, many different architectures of deep neural\n",
    "networks have been proposed, such as\n",
    "1. Convolutional neural networks, which are mostly used in image and video data processing, and have also been applied to sequential data such as text processing;\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning, a repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",

    "## Autoencoders: Overarching view\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning\n",
    "efficient representations of the input data (these representations are called codings)  without\n",
    "any supervision (i.e., the training set is unlabeled). These codings\n",
    "typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input data, making\n",
    "autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and\n",
    "they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks\n",
    "very similar to the training data; this is called a generative\n",
    "model. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of\n",
    "faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.  Surprisingly,\n",
    "autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their\n",
    "outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that\n",
    "constraining the network in various ways can make it rather\n",
    "difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the internal\n",
    "representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the\n",
    "network to recover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the\n",
    "autoencoder from trivially copying the inputs directly to the outputs,\n",
    "which forces it to learn efficient ways of representing the data. In\n",
    "short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s attempt to\n",
    "learn the identity function under some constraints.\n",

    "obtained from a source task to the target task, in order to resolve\n",
    "the issues of insufficient training data in the target task. The\n",
    "rationality of doing so lies in that usually the source and target\n",
