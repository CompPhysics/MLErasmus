    "\n",
    "## Neural network types\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",
    "consists of layers of connected neurons, or nodes or units.  We will\n",
    "refer to these interchangeably as units or nodes, and sometimes as\n",
    "neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each\n",
    "neuron interact with other neurons by sending signals in the form of\n",
    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",
    "each neuron can be approximated mathematically as a convolution\n",
    "operation.  (figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks emulate the behaviour of neurons in the\n",
    "visual cortex by enforcing a *local* connectivity pattern between\n",
    "nodes of adjacent layers: Each node in a convolutional layer is\n",
    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One uses often so-called fully-connected feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "with three or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers\n",
    "and an output layer) consisting of neurons that have non-linear\n",
    "activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such networks are often called *multilayer perceptrons* (MLPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why multilayer perceptrons?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward\n",
    "neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite\n",
    "number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional\n",
    "function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for\n",
    "the hidden layer is a **non-constant, bounded and\n",
    "monotonically-increasing continuous function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to\n",
    "the hidden layer, the output nodes are always assumed to be linear, so\n",
    "as to not restrict the range of output values.\n",

    "1. A neural network with one or more layers of nodes between the input and the output nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The multilayer network structure, or architecture, or topology, consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The input nodes pass values to the first hidden layer, its nodes pass the information on to the second and so on till we reach the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a convention it is normal to call  a  network with one layer of input units, one layer of hidden\n",
    "units and one layer of output units as  a two-layer network. A network with two layers of hidden units is called a three-layer network etc etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an MLP network there is no direct connection between the output nodes/neurons/units and  the input nodes/neurons/units.\n",
    "Hereafter we will call the various entities of a layer for nodes.\n",
    "There are also no connections within a single layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of input nodes does not need to equal the number of output\n",
    "nodes. This applies also to the hidden layers. Each layer may have its\n",

    "A typical choice for multiclass classification is the *cross-entropy* loss, also known as the negative log likelihood.  \n",

    "\n",

    "i.e. a binary bit string of length $C$, where $C = 10$ is the number of classes in the MNIST dataset.  \n",

    "Let $y_{ic}$ denote the $c$-th component of the $i$-th one-hot vector.  \n",
    "We define the cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ as a sum over the cross-entropy loss for each point $\\hat{x}_i$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the one-hot representation only one of the terms in the loss function is non-zero, namely the\n",
    "probability of the correct category $c'$  \n",
    "(i.e. the category $c'$ such that $y_{ic'} = 1$). This means that the cross entropy loss only punishes you for how wrong\n",
    "you got the correct label. The probability of category $c$ is given by the softmax function. The vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ represents the parameters of our network, i.e. all the weights and biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by finding the weights and biases that minimize the cost function. One of the most widely used classes of methods is *gradient descent* and its generalizations. The idea behind gradient descent\n",
    "is simply to adjust the weights in the direction where the gradient of the cost function is large and negative. This ensures we flow toward a *local* minimum of the cost function.  \n",
    "Each parameter $\\theta$ is iteratively adjusted according to the rule  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta_i) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is known as the *learning rate*, which controls how big a step we take towards the minimum.  \n",
    "This update can be repeated for any number of iterations, or until we are satisfied with the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective improvement is a variant called *Batch Gradient Descent*.  \n",
    "Instead of calculating the gradient on the whole dataset, we calculate an approximation of the gradient\n",
    "on a subset of the data called a *minibatch*.  \n",
    "If there are $N$ data points and we have a minibatch size of $M$, the total number of batches\n",
    "is $N/M$.  \n",
    "We denote each minibatch $B_k$, with $k = 1, 2,...,N/M$. The gradient then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i \\in B_k} \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. instead of averaging the loss over the entire dataset, we average over a minibatch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has two important benefits:  \n",
    "1. Introducing stochasticity decreases the chance that the algorithm becomes stuck in a local minima.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It significantly speeds up the calculation, since we do not have to use the entire dataset to calculate the gradient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The various optmization  methods, with codes and algorithms,  are discussed in our lectures on [Gradient descent approaches](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html).\n",

    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to add an extra term to the cost function, proportional\n",

    "size of the weights, so that they do not grow out of control.\n",
    "Constraining the size of the weights means that the weights cannot\n",
    "grow arbitrarily large to fit the training data, and in this way\n",
    "reduces *overfitting*.\n",

    "\n",

    "the cost function with respect to every bias and weight in the\n",
    "network.  In total our network has $(64 + 1)\\times 50=3250$ weights in\n",

    "calculate the gradient efficently. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Matrix  multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To more efficently train our network these equations are implemented using matrix operations.  \n",

    "high-level, object-oriented APIs like Keras, down to the C++ kernels\n",

    "simpler to use, but less flexible, and our choice of implementation\n",
    "should reflect the problems we are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tensorflow uses](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graphs) so-called graphs to represent your computation\n",
    "in terms of the dependencies between individual operations, such that you first build a Tensorflow *graph*\n",
    "to represent your model, and then create a Tensorflow *session* to run the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will analyze the same data as we did in our NumPy and\n",
    "scikit-learn tutorial, gathered from the MNIST database of images. We\n",
    "will give an introduction to the lower level Python Application\n",
    "Program Interfaces (APIs), and see how we use them to build our graph.\n",

    "differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance\n",

    "\n",
    "## Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems."
