    "Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\\hat{x} =[x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_p]^T$. \n",
    "The first variable is called the **dependent**, the **outcome** or the **response** variable while the set of variables $\\hat{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(y\\vert \\hat{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $y$ with a given $\\hat{x}$. The estimation of  $p(y\\vert \\hat{x})$ is made using a data set with \n",
    "* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",

    "* Response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",

    "* $p$ Explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\\hat{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$   \n",
    "\n",
    " The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $y_i$ and $\\hat{x}_i$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions .\n",

    "Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are\n",
    "measured. The data from this experiment are denoted $\\mathbf{X}$, with\n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$ as above. The matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design\n",
    "matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the\n",
    "form of $\\mathbf{Y}$ (also as above). The variable $\\mathbf{Y}$ is\n",
    "generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of\n",
    "regression analysis is to explain $\\mathbf{Y}$ in terms of\n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$ through a functional relationship like $Y_i =\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{X}_{i,\\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of\n",
    "$f(\\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship\n",
    "between $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$. This assumption gives rise to\n",
    "the *linear regression model* where $\\beta = (\\beta_1, \\ldots,\n",
    "\\beta_p)^{\\top}$ is the *regression parameter*. The parameter\n",
    "$\\beta_j$, $j=1, \\ldots, p$, represents the effect size of covariate\n",
    "$j$ on the response. That is, for each unit change in covariate $j$\n",

    "Before we proceed let us study a case from linear algebra where we aim at fitting a set of data $\\hat{y}=[y_0,y_1,\\dots,y_{n-1}]$. We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\\hat{x}=[x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since obtaining these data points may not be trivial, we want to use these data to fit a function which can allow us to make predictions for values of $y$ which are not in the present set. The perhaps simplest approach is to assume we can parametrize our function in terms of a polynomial of degree $n-1$ with $n$ points, that is"

Instead you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\\widehat \\theta$, apply the etsimator $\\widehat \\sigma^2$ to the values $\\widehat \\theta ^*$.\n",

The bootstrap analysis returns a data set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian, centered around the mean value $\\mu=100$ but with standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in this case the same as the number of original data points). The value of the standard deviation is what we expect from the central limit theorem."
