    "Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\\hat{x} =[x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_p]^T$. \n",
    "The first variable is called the **dependent**, the **outcome** or the **response** variable while the set of variables $\\hat{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(y\\vert \\hat{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $y$ with a given $\\hat{x}$. The estimation of  $p(y\\vert \\hat{x})$ is made using a data set with \n",
    "* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",

    "* Response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",

    "* $p$ Explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\\hat{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$   \n",
    "\n",
    " The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $y_i$ and $\\hat{x}_i$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions .\n",

    "Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are\n",
    "measured. The data from this experiment are denoted $\\mathbf{X}$, with\n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$ as above. The matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design\n",
    "matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the\n",
    "form of $\\mathbf{Y}$ (also as above). The variable $\\mathbf{Y}$ is\n",
    "generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of\n",
    "regression analysis is to explain $\\mathbf{Y}$ in terms of\n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$ through a functional relationship like $Y_i =\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{X}_{i,\\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of\n",
    "$f(\\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship\n",
    "between $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$. This assumption gives rise to\n",
    "the *linear regression model* where $\\beta = (\\beta_1, \\ldots,\n",
    "\\beta_p)^{\\top}$ is the *regression parameter*. The parameter\n",
    "$\\beta_j$, $j=1, \\ldots, p$, represents the effect size of covariate\n",
    "$j$ on the response. That is, for each unit change in covariate $j$\n",

    "Before we proceed let us study a case from linear algebra where we aim at fitting a set of data $\\hat{y}=[y_0,y_1,\\dots,y_{n-1}]$. We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\\hat{x}=[x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since obtaining these data points may not be trivial, we want to use these data to fit a function which can allow us to make predictions for values of $y$ which are not in the present set. The perhaps simplest approach is to assume we can parametrize our function in terms of a polynomial of degree $n-1$ with $n$ points, that is"
