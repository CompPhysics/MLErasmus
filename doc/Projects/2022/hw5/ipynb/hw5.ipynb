    "regression problems, starting with the regression algorithms studied\n",
    "in homework set 3 (exercise 2 in particular).\n",
    "We will include decision trees, random forests and eventually boosting\n",
    "methods  and neural network with **tensorflow** (feel free however to write your own code). \n",
    "\n",
    "The case we encounter here\n",
    "is  the so-called Ising model for  our training data and we will\n",
    "focus on supervised training. We will follow closely the recent\n",
    "article of [Mehta et al, arXiv\n",
    "1803.08823](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823). This article stands\n",
    "out as an excellent review on machine learning (ML) algorithms.\n",
    "The added benefit is that each figure and\n",
    "model presented in [this article is accompanied by its jupyter\n",
    "notebook](https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/MLnotebooks.html). This\n",
    "means that we can start using these and compare with our own results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also look up the [Regression slides for a discussion of the Ising model](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearningECT/doc/pub/Day1/html/Day1.html) (scroll down to the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can replace the Ising thorughout the exercises with the nuclear binding energies. The choice is yours. Or if you have other data sets suitable for regression, feel free to use those.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows here is however a discussion of the Ising model. The nuclear binding energies were discussed during the lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the abovementioned configurations we will determine, using first\n",
    "various regression methods, the value of the coupling constant for the\n",
    "energy of the one-dimensional Ising model.\n",
    "We will mainly use **scikit-learn** or **tensorflow** or other Python packages such as **keras** or other.\n",
