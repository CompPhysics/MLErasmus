===== Learning outcomes =====

!bblock
The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The course is project based and through the various projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

* Learn about basic data analysis, Monte Carlo methods, data optimization and machine learning;
* Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
* Have an understanding of central algorithms used in machine learning;
* Gain knowledge of central aspects of Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, and their possible applications;
* Understand linear methods for regression and classification;
* Learn about neural network, genetic algorithms and Boltzmann machines;
* Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.

===== Teaching and projects =====
!bblock

The course will be taught as an intensive  course of duration of two weeks, with a
total time of 30 h of lectures, 40 h of exercises and  2 projects that will be graded and form the final assessment. Each project counts 50% of the final grade. They have to be finalized two weeks after the course ended. 

The final assignment will be graded
with marks A, B, C, D, E and failed. The grades will be available not later than March 1.
