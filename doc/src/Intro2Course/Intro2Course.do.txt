===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: Thursday (2.15pm-4pm, this may change) and Friday (12.15pm-2pm).
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects and exercises.
  * Weekly exercises when not working on projects. You can hand in exercises if you want.
  * First hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects and exercises.
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the homepage of the course.
  * Computerlab: Tuesday (8am-4pm), VB IT-auditorium 3. Depending on how many enlist we may extend the lab sessions
  * Weekly plans and all other information are on the official webpage.
  * No final exam, three projects that are graded and have to be approved.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Three compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "devilry":"https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/" to hand in projects and "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.
    o For the last project Each group/participant submits a proposal or works with suggested (by us) proposals for the project.
    o If possible, we would like to organize the last project as a workshop where each group makes a poster and presents this to all other participants of the course
    o Poster session where all participants can study and discuss the other proposals.
    o Based on feedback etc, each group finalizes the report and submits for grading. 
  * Python is the default programming language, but feel free to use C/C++ and/or Fortran or other programmin languages. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course.
