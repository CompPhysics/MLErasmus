===== Logistic Regression =====

In linear regression our main interest was centered on learning the
coefficients of a functional fit (say a polynomial) in order to be
able to predict the response of a continuous variable on some unseen
data. The fit to the continuous variable $y_i$ is based on some
independent variables $\hat{x}_i$. Linear regression resulted in
analytical expressions (in terms of matrices to invert) for several
quantities, ranging from the variance and thereby the confidence
intervals of the parameters $\hat{\beta}$ to the mean squared
error. If we can invert the product of the design matrices, linear
regression gives then a simple recipe for fitting our data.


Classification problems, however, are concerned with outcomes taking
the form of discrete variables (i.e. categories). We may for example,
on the basis of DNA sequencing for a number of patients, like to find
out which mutations are important for a certain disease; or based on
scans of various patients' brains, figure out if there is a tumor or
not; or given a specific physical system, we'd like to identify its
state, say whether it is an ordered or disordered system (typical
situation in solid state physics); or classify the status of a
patient, whether she/he has a stroke or not and many other similar
situations.

The most common situation we encounter when we apply logistic
regression is that of two possible outcomes, normally denoted as a
binary outcome, true or false, positive or negative, success or
failure etc.

!split
===== Optimization and Deep learning =====

Logistic regression will also serve as our stepping stone towards neural
network algorithms and supervised deep learning. For logistic
learning, the minimization of the cost function leads to a non-linear
equation in the parameters $\hat{\beta}$. The optmization of the problem calls therefore for minimization algorithms. This forms the bottle neck of all machine learning algorithms, namely how to find reliable minima of a multi-variable function. This leads us to the family of gradient descent methods. The latter are the working horses of basically all modern machine learning algorithms. 

We note also that many of the topics discussed here 
regression are also commonly used in modern supervised Deep Learning
models, as we will see later.


!split 
===== Basics =====

We consider the case where the dependent variables, also called the
responses or the outcomes, $y_i$ are discrete and only take values
from $k=0,\dots,K-1$ (i.e. $K$ classes).

The goal is to predict the
output classes from the design matrix $\hat{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$
made of $n$ samples, each of which carries $p$ features or predictors. The
primary goal is to identify the classes to which new unseen samples
belong.
 
Let us specialize to the case of two classes only, with outputs $y_i=0$ and $y_i=1$. Our outcomes could represent the status of a credit card user who could default or not on her/his credit card debt. That is
!bt
\[
y_i = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \mathrm{no}\\  1 & \mathrm{yes} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et



!split
===== Linear classifier =====

Before moving to the logistic model, let us try to use our linear regression model to classify these two outcomes. We could for example fit a linear model to the default case if $y_i > 0.5$ and the no default case $y_i \leq 0.5$. 

We would then have our 
weighted linear combination, namely 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \hat{X}^T\hat{\beta} +  \hat{\epsilon},
\end{equation}
!et
where $\hat{y}$ is a vector representing the possible outcomes, $\hat{X}$ is our
$n\times p$ design matrix and $\hat{\beta}$ represents our estimators/predictors.

!split
===== Some selected properties =====

The main problem with our  function is that it 
takes values on the entire real axis. In the case of
logistic regression, however, the labels $y_i$ are discrete
variables. 

One simple way to get a discrete output is to have sign
functions that map the output of a linear regressor to values $\{0,1\}$,
$f(s_i)=sign(s_i)=1$ if $s_i\ge 0$ and 0 if otherwise. 
We will encounter this model in our first demonstration of neural networks. Historically it is called the ``perceptron" model in the machine learning
literature. This model is extremely simple. However, in many cases it is more
favorable to use a ``soft" classifier that outputs
the probability of a given category. This leads us to the logistic function.

The code for plotting the perceptron can be seen here. This si nothing but the standard "Heaviside step function":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function".

!split
===== The logistic function =====

The perceptron is an example of a ``hard classification'' model. We
will encounter this model when we discuss neural networks as
well. Each datapoint is deterministically assigned to a category (i.e
$y_i=0$ or $y_i=1$). In many cases, it is favorable to have a ``soft''
classifier that outputs the probability of a given category rather
than a single value. For example, given $x_i$, the classifier
outputs the probability of being in a category $k$.  Logistic regression
is the most common example of a so-called soft classifier. In logistic
regression, the probability that a data point $x_i$
belongs to a category $y_i=\{0,1\}$ is given by the so-called logit function (or Sigmoid) which is meant to represent the likelihood for a given event, 
!bt
\[
p(t) = \frac{1}{1+\mathrm \exp{-t}}=\frac{\exp{t}}{1+\mathrm \exp{t}}.
\]
!et
Note that $1-p(t)= p(-t)$.
The following code plots the logistic function.
!bc pycod

!ec



!split
=====  Two parameters =====

We assume now that we have two classes with $y_i$ either $0$ or $1$. Furthermore we assume also that we have only two parameters $\beta$ in our fitting of the Sigmoid function, that is we define probabilities 
!bt
\begin{align*}
p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}) &= \frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}},\nonumber\\
p(y_i=0|x_i,\hat{\beta}) &= 1 - p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}),
\end{align*}
!et
where $\hat{\beta}$ are the weights we wish to extract from data, in our case $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 

Note that we used
!bt
\[
p(y_i=0\vert x_i, \hat{\beta}) = 1-p(y_i=1\vert x_i, \hat{\beta}).
\]
!et

!split 
===== Maximum likelihood =====

In order to define the total likelihood for all possible outcomes from a  
dataset $\mathcal{D}=\{(y_i,x_i)\}$, with the binary labels
$y_i\in\{0,1\}$ and where the data points are drawn independently, we use the so-called "Maximum Likelihood Estimation":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" (MLE) principle. 
We aim thus at maximizing 
the probability of seeing the observed data. We can then approximate the 
likelihood in terms of the product of the individual probabilities of a specific outcome $y_i$, that is 
!bt
\begin{align*}
P(\mathcal{D}|\hat{\beta})& = \prod_{i=1}^n \left[p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta})\right]^{y_i}\left[1-p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}))\right]^{1-y_i}\nonumber \\
\end{align*}
!et
from which we obtain the log-likelihood and our _cost/loss_ function
!bt
\[
\mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i\log{p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta})} + (1-y_i)\log\left[1-p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}))\right]\right).
\]
!et

!split
===== The cost function rewritten =====

Reordering the logarithms, we can rewrite the _cost/loss_ function as
!bt
\[
\mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i) -\log{(1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)})}\right).
\]
!et

The maximum likelihood estimator is defined as the set of parameters that maximize the log-likelihood where we maximize with respect to $\beta$.
Since the cost (error) function is just the negative log-likelihood, for logistic regression we have that
!bt
\[
\mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})=-\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i) -\log{(1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)})}\right).
\]
!et
This equation is known in statistics as the _cross entropy_. Finally, we note that just as in linear regression, 
in practice we often supplement the cross-entropy with additional regularization terms, usually $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization as we did for Ridge and Lasso regression.

!split
=====  Minimizing the cross entropy =====

The cross entropy is a convex function of the weights $\hat{\beta}$ and,
therefore, any local minimizer is a global minimizer. 


Minimizing this
cost function with respect to the two parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ we obtain

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0} = -\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i -\frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right),
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_1} = -\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_ix_i -x_i\frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right).
\]
!et

!split
=====  A more compact expression =====

Let us now define a vector $\hat{y}$ with $n$ elements $y_i$, an
$n\times p$ matrix $\hat{X}$ which contains the $x_i$ values and a
vector $\hat{p}$ of fitted probabilities $p(y_i\vert x_i,\hat{\beta})$. We can rewrite in a more compact form the first
derivative of cost function as

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = -\hat{X}^T\left(\hat{y}-\hat{p}\right). 
\]
!et

If we in addition define a diagonal matrix $\hat{W}$ with elements 
$p(y_i\vert x_i,\hat{\beta})(1-p(y_i\vert x_i,\hat{\beta})$, we can obtain a compact expression of the second derivative as 

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}\partial \hat{\beta}^T} = \hat{X}^T\hat{W}\hat{X}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Extending to more predictors =====

Within a binary classification problem, we can easily expand our model to include multiple predictors. Our ratio between likelihoods is then with $p$ predictors
!bt
\[
\log{ \frac{p(\hat{\beta}\hat{x})}{1-p(\hat{\beta}\hat{x})}} = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\dots+\beta_px_p.
\]
!et
Here we defined $\hat{x}=[1,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_p]$ and $\hat{\beta}=[\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p]$ leading to
!bt
\[
p(\hat{\beta}\hat{x})=\frac{ \exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\dots+\beta_px_p)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\dots+\beta_px_p)}}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Including more classes =====

Till now we have mainly focused on two classes, the so-called binary system. Suppose we wish to extend to $K$ classes.
Let us for the sake of simplicity assume we have only two predictors. We have then following model
!bt
\[
\log{\frac{p(C=1\vert x)}{p(K\vert x)}} = \beta_{10}+\beta_{11}x_1,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\log{\frac{p(C=2\vert x)}{p(K\vert x)}} = \beta_{20}+\beta_{21}x_1,
\]
!et
and so on till the class $C=K-1$ class
!bt
\[
\log{\frac{p(C=K-1\vert x)}{p(K\vert x)}} = \beta_{(K-1)0}+\beta_{(K-1)1}x_1,
\]
!et
and the model is specified in term of $K-1$ so-called log-odds or _logit_ transformations.


!split
===== The Softmax function =====

In our discussion of neural networks we will encounter the above again in terms of the so-called _Softmax_ function.

The softmax function is used in various multiclass classification
methods, such as multinomial logistic regression (also known as
softmax regression), multiclass linear discriminant
analysis, naive Bayes classifiers, and artificial neural networks.
Specifically, in multinomial logistic regression and linear
discriminant analysis, the input to the function is the result of $K$
distinct linear functions, and the predicted probability for the $k$-th
class given a sample vector $\hat{x}$ and a weighting vector $\hat{\beta}$ is (with two predictors):

!bt
\[
p(C=k\vert \mathbf {x} )=\frac{\exp{(\beta_{k0}+\beta_{k1}x_1)}}{1+\sum_{l=1}^{K-1}\exp{(\beta_{l0}+\beta_{l1}x_1)}}.
\]
!et
It is easy to extend to more predictors. The final class is 
!bt
\[
p(C=K\vert \mathbf {x} )=\frac{1}{1+\sum_{l=1}^{K-1}\exp{(\beta_{l0}+\beta_{l1}x_1)}},
\]
!et
and they sum to one. Our earlier discussions were all specialized to the case with two classes only. It is easy to see from the above that what we derived earlier is compatible with these equations. 

To find the optimal parameters we would typically use a gradient descent method.
Newton's method and gradient descent methods are discussed in the material on "optimization methods":"https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html".

===== The two-dimensional Ising model, Predicting phase transition of the two-dimensional Ising model =====

The Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional Ising model without an external field for a constant coupling constant $J$ is given by
!bt
\begin{align}
    H = -J \sum_{\langle ij\rangle} S_i S_j,
\end{align}
!et
where $S_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ and $\langle ij \rangle$ signifies that we only iterate over the nearest neighbors in the lattice. We will be looking at a system of $L = 40$ spins in each dimension, i.e., $L^2 = 1600$ spins in total. Opposed to the one-dimensional Ising model we will get a phase transition from an _ordered_ phase to a _disordered_ phase at the critical temperature

!bt
\begin{align}
    \frac{T_c}{J} = \frac{2}{\log\left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right)} \approx 2.26,
\end{align}
!et
as shown by Lars Onsager.


Here we use _logistic regression_ to predict when a phase transition
occurs. The data we will look at is a set of spin configurations,
i.e., individual lattices with spins, labeled _ordered_ `1` or
_disordered_ `0`. Our job is to build a model which will take in a
spin configuration and predict whether or not the spin configuration
constitutes an ordered or a disordered phase. To achieve this we will
represent the lattices as flattened arrays with $1600$ elements
instead of a matrix of $40 \times 40$ elements. As an extra test of
the performance of the algorithms we will divide the dataset into
three pieces. We will do a conventional train-test-split on a
combination of totally ordered and totally disordered phases. The
remaining "critical-like" states will be used as test data which we
hope the model will be able to make good extrapolated predictions on.

===== Reading in the data =====

Using the data from "Mehta et al.":"https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/ML-Review-Datasets/isingMC/" (specifically the two datasets named `Ising2DFM_reSample_L40_T=All.pkl` and `Ising2DFM_reSample_L40_T=All_labels.pkl`) we have to unpack the data into numpy arrays.

This dataset consists of $10000$ samples, i.e., $10000$ spin
configurations with $40 \times 40$ spins each, for $16$ temperatures
between $0.25$ to $4.0$. Next we create a train/test-split and keep
the data in the critical phase as a separate dataset for
extrapolation-testing.

!split
===== Logistic regression =====

Logistic regression is a linear model for classification. Recalling
the cost function for ordinary least squares with both L2 (ridge) and
L1 (LASSO) penalties we will see that the logistic cost function is
very similar. In OLS we wish to predict a continuous variable
$\hat{y}$ using
!bt
\begin{align}
    \hat{y} = X\omega,
\end{align}
!et

where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ is the input data and $\omega^{p
\times d}$ are the weights of the regression. In a classification
setting (binary classification in our situation) we are interested in
a positive or negative answer. We can thus define either answer to be
above or below some threshold. But, in order to limit the size of the
answer and also to get a probability interpretation on how sure we are
for either answer we can compute the sigmoid function of OLS. That is,

!bt
\begin{align}
    f(X\omega) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-X\omega)}.
\end{align}
!et
We are thus interested in minizming the following cost function
!bt
\begin{align}
    C(X, \omega) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left\{
        - y_i\log\left( f(x_i^T\omega) \right)
        - (1 - y_i)\log\left[1 - f(x_i^T\omega)\right]
    \right\},
\end{align}
!et

where we will restrict ourselves to a value for $f(z)$ as the sigmoid
described above. We can also tack on a L2 (Ridge) or L1 (LASSO)
penalization to this cost function in the same manner we did for
linear regression.

!split
===== Exploring the logistic regression =====

The penalization factor $\lambda$ is inverted in the case of the
logistic regression model we use. We will explore several values of
$\lambda$ using both L1 and L2 penalization. We do this using a grid
search over different parameters and run a 3-fold cross validation for
each configuration. In other words, we fit a model 3 times for each
configuration of the hyper parameters.


!bc pycod
lambdas = np.logspace(-7, -1, 7)

param_grid = {
    "C": list(1.0/lambdas),
    "penalty": ["l1", "l2"]
}
clf = skms.GridSearchCV(
    skl.LogisticRegression(),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    n_jobs=-1,
    return_train_score=True
)
t0 = time.time()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
t1 = time.time()

print (
    "Time spent fitting GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression): {0:.3f} sec".format(
        t1 - t0
    )
)
!ec

We can see that logistic regression is quite slow and using the grid
search and cross validation results in quite a heavy
computation. Below we show the results of the different
configurations.


!bc pycod
logreg_df = pd.DataFrame(clf.cv_results_)

display(logreg_df)

!split
===== Accuracy of a classification model =====

To determine how well a classification model is performing we count
the number of correctly labeled classes and divide by the number of
classes in total. The accuracy is thus given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    a(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} I(y_i = \hat{y}_i),
\end{align}
!et

where $I(y_i = \hat{y}_i)$ is the indicator function given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    I(x = y) = \begin{array}{cc}
    1 & x = y, \\
    0 & x \neq y.
    \end{array}
\end{align}
!et

This is the accuracy provided by Scikit-learn when using _sklearn.metrics.accuracyscore_.

Below we compute the accuracy of the best fit model on the training data (which should give a good accuracy), the test data (which has not been shown to the model) and the critical data (completely new data that needs to be extrapolated).


!bc pycod
train_accuracy = skm.accuracy_score(y_train, clf.predict(X_train))
test_accuracy = skm.accuracy_score(y_test, clf.predict(X_test))
critical_accuracy = skm.accuracy_score(labels[critical], clf.predict(data[critical]))

print ("Accuracy on train data: {0}".format(train_accuracy))
print ("Accuracy on test data: {0}".format(test_accuracy))
print ("Accuracy on critical data: {0}".format(critical_accuracy))
!ec

We can see that we get quite good accuracy on the training data, but gradually worsening accuracy on the test and critical data.

!split
===== Analyzing the results =====

Below we show a different metric for determining the quality of our
model, namely the _reciever operating characteristic_ (ROC). The ROC
curve tells us how well the model correctly classifies the different
labels. We plot the _true positive rate_ (the rate of predicted
positive classes that are positive) versus the _false positive rate_
(the rate of predicted positive classes that are negative). The ROC
curve is built by computing the true positive rate and the false
positive rate for varying _thresholds_, i.e, which probability we
should acredit a certain class.

By computing the _area under the curve_ (AUC) of the ROC curve we get an estimate of how well our model is performing. Pure guessing will get an AUC of $0.5$. A perfect score will get an AUC of $1.0$.


!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))

for (_X, _y), label in zip(
    [
        (X_train, y_train),
        (X_test, y_test),
        (data[critical], labels[critical])
    ],
    ["Train", "Test", "Critical"]
):
    proba = clf.predict_proba(_X)
    fpr, tpr, _ = skm.roc_curve(_y, proba[:, 1])
    roc_auc = skm.auc(fpr, tpr)

    print ("LogisticRegression AUC ({0}): {1}".format(label, roc_auc))

    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label="{0} (AUC = {1})".format(label, roc_auc), linewidth=4.0)

plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], "--", label="Guessing (AUC = 0.5)", linewidth=4.0)

plt.title(r"The ROC curve for LogisticRegression", fontsize=18)
plt.xlabel(r"False positive rate", fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel(r"True positive rate", fontsize=18)

plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
plt.legend(loc="best", fontsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec

We can see that this plot of the ROC looks very strange. This tells us
that logistic regression is quite inept at predicting the Ising model
transition and is therefore highly non-linear. The ROC curve for the
training data looks quite good, but as the testing data is so far off
we see that we are dealing with an overfit model.

The following runs the data preparation that is used for all models.

We scale all features by SciKit-learn's standard scaler. The standard
scalars subtracts the mean, so that the means of the standardized
variables equal zero. Furthermore the standard scaler divides the
features by their respective variances, meaning that the variances of the
standardized features equals one.

This is not the same number of observations as in Yeh and Lien
(2009). Yeh and Lien (2009) have 25 000 observations. However, we have
the same number of observations as in Pyzhov and Pyzhov (2017), which
is said to use the same dataset as Yeh and Lien (2009).

The percentage of individuals with default is the same as in the Yeh and Lien (2009).


Will will essentially deal with two classes.
For two classen and two paramaters we have
!bt
\begin{align*}
p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}) &= \frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}},\nonumber\\
p(y_i=0|x_i,\hat{\beta}) &= 1 - p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}),
\end{align*}
!et
The solution is found by maximizing the likelihhod function
!bt
\begin{align*}
P(\mathcal{D}|\hat{\beta})& = \prod_{i=1}^n \left[p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta})\right]^{y_i}\left[1-p(y_i=1|x_i,\hat{\beta}))\right]^{1-y_i}\nonumber \\
\end{align*}
!et
We will use the cross-entropy as objective function. The cross-entropy is the negative log of the likelihood function

!bt
\mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})=-\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i) -\log{(1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)})}\right).
!et
The minus sign in the cross-entropy is in order to make this a convex function so that we get a minimization problem. 

To find the minimum of the above function, we differentiate it and set the result to zero

!bt
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0} = -\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i -\frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right),
!et

!bt
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_1} = -\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_ix_i -x_i\frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right). 
!et

The above can be rewritten as
!bt
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = -\hat{X}^T\left(\hat{y}-\hat{p}\right).
!et

We see that there is no explicit expression for the parameters, like
we have in e.g. OLS. Hence iterative methods must be applied, and we
will apply the gradient descent method which basically says for some
variabe $\theta$, we update it with

!bt
\hat{\theta} = \hat{\theta} - \eta \nabla \hat{\theta}.
!et

The second term in the above equation is the gradient. In our case the
gradient for the regression parameters are given by the linear algebra
equation above
