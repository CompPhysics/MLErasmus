===== Types of Machine Learning, a repetition =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

  * Other unsupervised learning algortihms, here Boltzmann machines

===== Why Boltzmann machines? =====

What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a lot of attention lately. 
One of the major reasons is that they can be stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture complicated statistics.

The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous data that are common to natural images. 

Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.

===== A brief review on Markov Chains, Metropolis and Gibbs sampling =====


* We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.
* We start with a PDF $w(x_0,t_0)$  and we want to understand how the system evolves with time.
* We want to reach a situation where after a given number of time steps we obtain a steady state. This means that the system reaches its most likely state (equilibrium situation)
* Our PDF is normally a multidimensional object whose normalization constant is impossible to find.
* Analytical calculations from $w(x,t)$ are not possible.
* To sample directly from from $w(x,t)$ is not possible/difficult.
* The transition probability $W$ is also not  known.
* How can we establish that we have reached a steady state?   Sounds impossible!

_Use Markov chain Monte Carlo_

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes =====
A Markov process is a random walk with a selected probability for making a
move. The new move is independent of the previous history of the system.

The Markov process is used repeatedly in Monte Carlo simulations in order to generate
new random states.

The reason for choosing a Markov process is that when it is run for a
long enough time starting with a random state, we will eventually reach the most likely state of the system.

In thermodynamics, this means that after a certain number of Markov processes
we reach an equilibrium distribution.

This mimicks the way a real system reaches
its most likely state at a given temperature of the surroundings.

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes, Ergodicity and Detailed balance =====

To reach this distribution, the Markov process needs to obey two important conditions, that of
_ergodicity_ and _detailed balance_. These conditions impose then constraints on our algorithms
for accepting or rejecting new random states.


The Metropolis algorithm discussed here
abides to both these constraints.

The Metropolis algorithm is widely used in Monte Carlo
simulations and the understanding of it rests within
the interpretation of random walks and Markov processes.

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes, jargon =====

In a random walk one defines a mathematical entity called a _walker_, 
whose  attributes
completely define the state of the system in question. 

The state of the system  can refer to any physical quantities,
from the vibrational state of a molecule specified by a set of quantum numbers, 
to the brands of coffee in your favourite supermarket.


The walker moves in an appropriate state space by a combination of 
deterministic and random displacements from its previous
position.

This sequence of steps forms a _chain_.

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes, sequence of ingredients =====

* We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.
* Markov chains are intimately linked with the physical process of diffusion. 
* From a Markov chain we can then derive the conditions for detailed balance and ergodicity. These are the conditions needed for obtaining a steady state.
* The widely used algorithm for doing this is the so-called Metropolis algorithm, in its refined form the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

The Black and Scholes equation is a partial differential equation, which describes the price
of the option over time. It is a diffusion equation with a random term.

The list of applications is endless.


!split
===== Markov processes =====
!bblock
A Markov process allows in principle for a microscopic description of Brownian motion.
As with the random walk studied in the previous section, we consider a particle 
which moves along the  $x$-axis in the form of a series of jumps with step length 
$\Delta x = l$. Time and space are discretized and the subsequent moves are
statistically independent, i.e., the new move depends only on the previous step
and not on the results from earlier trials. 
We start at a position $x=jl=j\Delta x$ and move to 
a new position $x =i\Delta x$ during a step $\Delta t=\epsilon$, where 
$i\ge  0$ and $j\ge 0$ are integers. 
The original probability distribution function (PDF) of the particles is given by  
$w_i(t=0)$ where $i$ refers to a specific position on the grid in 
!eblock
The function $w_i(t=0)$ is now the discretized version of $w(x,t)$.
We can regard the discretized PDF as a vector.

!split
===== Markov processes =====
!bblock
For the Markov process we have a transition probability from a position
$x=jl$ to a position $x=il$ given by
!bt
\begin{equation*}
   W_{ij}(\epsilon)=W(il-jl,\epsilon)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2} & |i-j| = 1\\
             0 & \mathrm{else} \end{array} \right. ,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $W_{ij}$ is normally called 
the transition probability and we can represent it, see below,
as a matrix. 
_Here we have specialized to a case where the transition probability is known_.

Our new PDF $w_i(t=\epsilon)$ is now related to the PDF at
$t=0$ through the relation

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   w_i(t=\epsilon) =\sum_{j} W(j\rightarrow i)w_j(t=0).
\end{equation*}
!et
 
This equation represents the discretized time-development of an original 
PDF with equal probability of jumping left or right.
!eblock

!split
===== Markov processes, the probabilities =====
!bblock

Since both $W$ and $w$ represent probabilities, they have to be normalized, i.e., we require
that at each time step we have

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   \sum_i w_i(t) = 1, 
\end{equation*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   \sum_j W(j\rightarrow i) = 1,
\end{equation*}
!et
which applies for all $j$-values.
The further constraints are
$0 \le W_{ij} \le 1$  and  $0 \le w_{j} \le 1$.
Note that the probability for remaining at the same place is in general 
not necessarily equal zero. 
!eblock

!split
===== Markov processes =====
!bblock
The time development of our initial PDF can now be represented through the action of
the transition probability matrix applied $n$ times. At a 
time  $t_n=n\epsilon$ our initial distribution has developed into

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   w_i(t_n) = \sum_jW_{ij}(t_n)w_j(0),
\end{equation*}
!et
and defining

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   W(il-jl,n\epsilon)=(W^n(\epsilon))_{ij}
\end{equation*}
!et
we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   w_i(n\epsilon) = \sum_j(W^n(\epsilon))_{ij}w_j(0),
\end{equation*}
!et
or in matrix form
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:wfinal}
   \hat{w}(n\epsilon) = \hat{W}^n(\epsilon)\hat{w}(0).
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== An Illustrative Example =====
!bblock

The following simple example may help in understanding the meaning of 
the transition matrix $\hat{W}$ and the vector $\hat{w}$.
Consider the $4\times 4$ matrix $\hat{W}$

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{W} = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 1/4 & 1/9 & 3/8 & 1/3 \\                   
                                       2/4 & 2/9 & 0 & 1/3\\                   
                                       0   & 1/9 & 3/8 & 0\\
                                       1/4 & 5/9&  2/8 & 1/3 \end{array} \right),
\end{equation*}
!et
and we choose our initial state as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{w}(t=0)=  \left(\begin{array}{c} 1\\                   
                                 0\\
                                 0 \\                   
                                 0 \end{array} \right).
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== An Illustrative Example =====
!bblock
We note that both the vector and the matrix are properly normalized. Summing the vector elements gives one and
summing over columns for the matrix results also in one.  Furthermore, the largest eigenvalue is one.
We act then on $\hat{w}$ with $\hat{W}$.
The first iteration is

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{w}(t=\epsilon) = \hat{W}\hat{w}(t=0),
\end{equation*}
!et
 
resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{w}(t=\epsilon)=  \left(\begin{array}{c} 1/4\\                   
                                1/2 \\
                                0 \\                   
                                1/4 \end{array} \right).
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== An Illustrative Example, next step =====
!bblock

The next iteration results in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{w}(t=2\epsilon) = \hat{W}\hat{w}(t=\epsilon),
\end{equation*}
!et
 
resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{w}(t=2\epsilon)=  \left(\begin{array}{c} 0.201389\\
   0.319444 \\
   0.055556 \\
   0.423611 \end{array} \right).
\end{equation*}
!et
Note that the vector $\hat{w}$ is always normalized to $1$. 
!eblock
!split
===== An Illustrative Example, the steady state =====
!bblock
We find the steady state of the system by solving the set of equations

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
w(t=\infty) = Ww(t=\infty),
\end{equation*}
!et
which is an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue equal to _one_!
This set of equations reads
!bt
\begin{align}
 W_{11}w_1(t=\infty) +W_{12}w_2(t=\infty) +W_{13}w_3(t=\infty)+ W_{14}w_4(t=\infty)=&w_1(t=\infty) \nonumber \\
W_{21}w_1(t=\infty) + W_{22}w_2(t=\infty) + W_{23}w_3(t=\infty)+ W_{24}w_4(t=\infty)=&w_2(t=\infty) \nonumber \\
W_{31}w_1(t=\infty) + W_{32}w_2(t=\infty) + W_{33}w_3(t=\infty)+ W_{34}w_4(t=\infty)=&w_3(t=\infty) \nonumber \\
W_{41}w_1(t=\infty) + W_{42}w_2(t=\infty) + W_{43}w_3(t=\infty)+ W_{44}w_4(t=\infty)=&w_4(t=\infty) \nonumber \\
\end{align}
!et
with the constraint that

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \sum_i w_i(t=\infty) = 1, 
\end{equation*}
!et
yielding as solution

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{w}(t=\infty)=  \left(\begin{array}{c}0.244318 \\                   
                                 0.319602 \\  0.056818 \\  0.379261 \end{array} \right).
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== An Illustrative Example, iterative steps =====

===== An Illustrative Example, what does it mean? =====
!bblock

We have after $t$-steps

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{w}(t) = \hat{W}^t\hat{w}(0),
\end{equation*}
!et
with $\hat{w}(0)$ the distribution at $t=0$ and $\hat{W}$ representing the 
transition probability matrix. 

!eblock

!split
===== An Illustrative Example, understanding the basics =====
!bblock

We can always expand $\hat{w}(0)$ in terms of the right eigenvectors 
$\hat{v}$ of $\hat{W}$ as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{w}(0)  = \sum_i\alpha_i\hat{v}_i,
\end{equation*}
!et
resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{w}(t) = \hat{W}^t\hat{w}(0)=\hat{W}^t\sum_i\alpha_i\hat{v}_i=
\sum_i\lambda_i^t\alpha_i\hat{v}_i,
\end{equation*}
!et
with $\lambda_i$ the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ eigenvalue corresponding to  
the eigenvector $\hat{v}_i$. 

If we assume that $\lambda_0$ is the largest eigenvector we see that in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$,
$\hat{w}(t)$ becomes proportional to the corresponding eigenvector 
$\hat{v}_0$. This is our steady state or final distribution.

===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

Let us recapitulate some of our results about Markov chains and random walks.

  * The time development of our PDF $w(t)$, after 
one time-step from $t=0$ is given by  
!bt
\begin{equation*}    
w_i(t=\epsilon) = W(j\rightarrow i)w_j(t=0).
\end{equation*}
!et
 
This equation represents the discretized time-development of an original 
PDF.  We can rewrite this as a

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   w_i(t=\epsilon) = W_{ij}w_j(t=0).
\end{equation*}
!et
with the transition matrix $W$ for a random walk given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   W_{ij}(\epsilon)=W(il-jl,\epsilon)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2} & |i-j| = 1\\
                                             0 & \mathrm{else} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}
!et

!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

We call $W_{ij}$ for the transition probability and we represent it
as a matrix. 
  * Both  $W$ and $w$ represent probabilities and they have to be normalized, meaning that at each time step we have   
!bt 
\begin{equation*}    
\sum_i w_i(t) = 1,
\end{equation*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   \sum_j W(j\rightarrow i) = 1.
\end{equation*}
!et
Here we have written the previous matrix $W_{ij}=W(j\rightarrow i)$.

!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

The further constraints are
$0 \le W_{ij} \le 1$  and  $0 \le w_{j} \le 1$.
  * We can thus write the action of $W$ as   
!bt 
\begin{equation*}    
w_i(t+1) = \sum_jW_{ij}w_j(t),
\end{equation*}
!et
or as vector-matrix relation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{w}(t+1) = \hat{W\hat{w}}(t),
\end{equation*}
!et
and if we have that $||\hat{w}(t+1)-\hat{w}(t)||\rightarrow 0$, we say that 
we have reached the most likely state of the system, the so-called steady state or equilibrium state.
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

Another way of phrasing this is
!bt
\begin{equation} 
w(t=\infty) = Ww(t=\infty). 
\end{equation}   
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

The question then is how can we model anything under such a severe lack of knowledge? The Metropolis algorithm comes to our rescue here. Since $W(j\rightarrow i)$ is unknown, we model it as the product of two probabilities, 
a probability for accepting the proposed move from the state $j$ to the state $j$, and a probability for making the transition to the state $i$ being in the state $j$. We label these probabilities $A(j\rightarrow i)$ and $T(j\rightarrow i)$, respectively.  Our total transition probability is then

!bt
\begin{equation*}
W(j\rightarrow i)=T(j\rightarrow i)A(j\rightarrow i).
\end{equation*}
!et
The algorithm can then be expressed as

  * We make a suggested move to the new state $i$ with some transition or moving probability $T_{j\rightarrow i}$.

  * We accept this move to the new state with an acceptance probability $A_{j \rightarrow i}$. The new state $i$ is in turn used as our new starting point for the next move.  We reject this proposed moved with a $1-A_{j\rightarrow i}$ and the original state $j$ is used again as a sample.
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

We wish to derive the required properties of the probabilities $T$ and $A$ such that
$w_i^{(t\rightarrow \infty)} \rightarrow w_i$, starting
from any distribution, will lead us to the correct distribution.

We can now derive the dynamical process towards 
equilibrium. To obtain this equation we note that after $t$ time steps the probability for being in a state $i$ is related 
to the probability of being in a state $j$ and performing a transition to the new state together with the probability of actually being in the state $i$ and making a move to any of the possible states $j$ from the previous time step.
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

We can express this as, assuming that $T$ and $A$ are time-independent,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
w_i(t+1) = \sum_j \left [
w_j(t)T_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
+w_i(t)T_{i\rightarrow j}\left ( 1- A_{i\rightarrow j} \right)
\right ] \,.
\end{equation*}
!et

===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====

All probabilities are normalized, meaning that 
$\sum_j T_{i\rightarrow j} = 1$. Using the latter, we can rewrite the previous equation as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) +
 \sum_j \left [
w_j(t)T_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
-w_i(t)T_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}\right ] \,,
\end{equation*}
!et
which can be rewritten as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
w_i(t+1)-w_i(t) =  \sum_j \left [w_j(t)T_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
-w_i(t)T_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}\right ] .

The last equation is very similar to the so-called Master equation, which relates the temporal dependence of 
a PDF $w_i(t)$ to various transition rates. The equation can be derived from the so-called 
Chapman-Einstein-Enskog-Kolmogorov equation. The equation is given as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:masterequation}
\frac{d w_i(t)}{dt} = \sum_j\left[ W(j\rightarrow i)w_j-W(i\rightarrow j)w_i\right],
\end{equation}
!et
which simply states that the rate at which the systems moves from a state $j$
to a final state $i$ (the first term on the right-hand side of the last equation) is balanced by the rate at which the system undergoes transitions from the state $i$ to a state $j$ (the second term). If we have reached the so-called steady state, then the temporal development is zero. This  means that in equilibrium we have

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d w_i(t)}{dt} = 0.
\end{equation*}
!et

In the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ we require that the  two distributions $w_i(t+1)=w_i$ and $w_i(t)=w_i$
and we have

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \sum_j w_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}= \sum_j w_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j},
\end{equation*}
!et
which is the condition for balance when the most likely state (or steady state) has been reached.
We see also that the right-hand side  can be  rewritten as

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
\sum_j w_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}= \sum_j w_iW_{i\rightarrow j},
\end{equation*}
!et
and using the property that $\sum_j W_{i\rightarrow j}=1$, we can rewrite our equation
as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
w_i= \sum_j w_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}= \sum_j w_j W_{j\rightarrow i},
\end{equation*}
!et
which is nothing but the standard equation for a Markov chain when the steady state has been reached.

However, the condition that the rates should equal each other is in general not sufficient
to guarantee that we, after many simulations, generate the correct distribution.
We may risk to end up with so-called cyclic solutions. To avoid this
we therefore introduce an additional condition, namely that of detailed balance

!bt
\begin{equation*} W(j\rightarrow i)w_j= W(i\rightarrow j)w_i.  \end{equation*}
!et
These equations were derived by Lars Onsager when studying irreversible processes.
At equilibrium detailed balance gives thus

!bt
\begin{equation*} \frac{W(j\rightarrow i)}{W(i\rightarrow j)}=\frac{w_i}{w_j}.  \end{equation*}
!et
Rewriting the last equation in terms of our transition probabilities $T$ and 
acceptance probobalities $A$ we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
w_j(t)T_{j\rightarrow i}A_{j\rightarrow i}= w_i(t)T_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}.
\end{equation*}

Since we normally have an expression 
for the probability distribution functions $w_i$,  we can rewrite the last equation as

In statistical physics this condition ensures that it is e.g., the 
Boltzmann distribution which is generated when equilibrium is reached.

We introduce  now the Boltzmann distribution

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   w_i= \frac{\exp{(-\beta(E_i))}}{Z},
\end{equation*}
!et
which states that the probability of finding the system in a state $i$ with energy $E_i$ 
at an inverse temperature $\beta = 1/k_BT$ is $w_i\propto \exp{(-\beta(E_i))}$.
The denominator $Z$ is a normalization constant which ensures that the sum of all
probabilities is normalized to one. It is defined as the sum of probabilities over all microstates
$j$ of the system

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   Z=\sum_j \exp{(-\beta(E_i))}.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====

From the partition function we can in principle generate all interesting quantities
for a given system in equilibrium with its surroundings at a temperature $T$.

With the probability distribution given by the Boltzmann distribution we are now in a position
where we can generate expectation values for a given variable $A$ through the
definition

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \langle A \rangle = \sum_jA_jw_j=
    \frac{\sum_jA_j\exp{(-\beta(E_j)}}{Z}.
\end{equation*}
!et
In general, most systems have an infinity of microstates making thereby the computation
of $Z$ practically impossible and 
a brute force Monte Carlo calculation over a given number of randomly selected microstates
may therefore not yield those microstates which are important 
at equilibrium. 
To select the most important contributions we need to  
use the condition for detailed balance. Since this is just given by the ratios of probabilities,
we never need to evaluate the partition function $Z$.

For the 
Boltzmann distribution, detailed balance results in

!bt
\begin{equation*} \frac{w_i}{w_j}= \exp{(-\beta(E_i-E_j))}. \end{equation*}
!et

Let us now specialize to a system whose energy is defined by the orientation of single spins.
Consider the state $i$, with given energy $E_i$ represented by the following $N$ spins

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
\uparrow&\uparrow&\uparrow&\dots&\uparrow&\downarrow&\uparrow&\dots&\uparrow&\downarrow\\
1&2&3&\dots& k-1&k&k+1&\dots&N-1&N\end{array}

We are interested in the transition with one single  spinflip to a new state $j$ with energy $E_j$

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
\uparrow&\uparrow&\uparrow&\dots&\uparrow&\uparrow&\uparrow&\dots&\uparrow&\downarrow\\
1&2&3&\dots& k-1&k&k+1&\dots&N-1&N\end{array}
\end{equation*}
!et
This change from one microstate $i$ (or spin configuration)  to another microstate $j$ is the
configuration space analogue to a random walk on a lattice. Instead of jumping from 
one place to another in space, we 'jump' from one microstate to another.
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

However, the selection of states has to generate a final distribution which is the
Boltzmann distribution. This is again the same we saw for a random walker, for the discrete case we had 
always a binomial distribution, whereas for the continuous case we had a normal distribution.
The way we sample configurations should result, when equilibrium is established, in the 
Boltzmann distribution. Else, our algorithm for selecting microstates is wrong.
 

As stated above, we do in general not know the closed-form expression of the transition rate and we are free to model it as
     $W(i\rightarrow j)=T(i\rightarrow j)A(i\rightarrow j)$.
Our ratio between probabilities gives us

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
\frac{A_{j\rightarrow i}}{A_{i\rightarrow j}}= \frac{w_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{w_jT_{j\rightarrow i}}.
\end{equation*}
!et
The simplest form of the Metropolis algorithm (sometimes called for brute force Metropolis) assumes that 
the transition probability $T(i\rightarrow j)$ is symmetric, implying that $T(i\rightarrow j)=T(j\rightarrow i)$.

!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

We obtain then (using the Boltzmann distribution)

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A(j\rightarrow i)}{A(i\rightarrow j)}= \exp{(-\beta(E_i-E_j))} .
\end{equation*}
!et
We are in this case interested in a new state $E_j$ whose energy is lower than 
$E_i$, viz., $\Delta E = E_j-E_i \le 0$. A simple test would then be to accept only those
microstates which lower the energy.  
Suppose we have ten microstates with energy $E_0 \le E_1 \le E_2 \le E_3 \le \dots \le E_9$.
Our desired energy is $E_0$.

!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

At a given temperature $T$ we start our simulation by randomly choosing state
$E_9$. Flipping spins we may then find a path from $E_9\rightarrow E_8 \rightarrow E_7 \dots \rightarrow E_1 \rightarrow E_0$. 
This would however lead to biased statistical averages since it would violate the ergodic hypothesis discussed
in the previous section. This principle states  that 
it should be possible for any Markov process to reach every possible state of the system
from any starting point if the simulations is carried out for a long enough time.

Any state in a Boltzmann distribution has a probability different from zero and if such 
a state cannot be reached from a given starting point, then the system is not ergodic.
This means that another possible path to $E_0$ could be 
$E_9\rightarrow E_7 \rightarrow E_8 \dots \rightarrow E_9 \rightarrow E_5 \rightarrow E_0$ and so forth.
Even though such a path could have a negligible probability it is still a possibility, and if
we simulate long enough it should be included in our computation of an expectation value.
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

Thus, we require that our algorithm should satisfy the principle of detailed balance and be ergodic. 
The problem with our ratio

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A(j\rightarrow i)}{A(i\rightarrow j)}= \exp{(-\beta(E_i-E_j))}, 
\end{equation*}
!et
is that we do not know the acceptance probability. This equation only specifies the ratio of pairs of probabilities. Normally we want an algorithm which is as efficient as possible and maximizes the number of accepted moves. 
Moreover, we know that the acceptance probability has $0$ as its smallest value and $1$ as its largest. 
If we assume that the largest possible acceptance probability is $1$,  we adjust thereafter the other acceptance probability
to this constraint. 
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

To understand this better, assume that we have two energies, $E_i$ and $E_j$, with $E_i < E_j$. This means that the largest acceptance value must be 
$A(j\rightarrow i)$ since we move to a state with lower energy.  It follows from also from the fact that the probability $w_i$ is larger than $w_j$. 
The trick then is to fix this value to $A(j\rightarrow i)=1$. It means that 
the other acceptance probability has to be

!bt
\begin{equation*}
A(i\rightarrow j)= \exp{(-\beta(E_j-E_i))}.
\end{equation*}
!et

!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

One possible way to encode this equation reads

!bt
\begin{equation*}       
A(j\rightarrow i)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\exp{(-\beta(E_i-E_j))} & E_i-E_j > 0 \\ 1 & else \end{array} \right.,  
\end{equation*}
!et
implying that if we move to a state with a lower energy, we always accept
this move with acceptance probability $A(j\rightarrow i)=1$. If the energy is higher, we need to check
this acceptance probability with the ratio between the probabilities  from our PDF.  From a practical point of view, 
the above ratio is compared with a random number.
If the ratio is smaller than a given random number we accept the move to a higher energy, else we stay in the same state. 

!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis Algorithm and Detailed Balance  =====
!bblock

Nothing hinders us obviously in choosing another acceptance ratio, like a weighting  of the two energies via

!bt
\begin{equation*}
A(j\rightarrow i)=\exp{(-\frac{1}{2}\beta(E_i-E_j))}.
\end{equation*}
!et
However, it is easy to see that such an acceptance ratio would result in 
fewer accepted moves.

===== Brief Summary =====

The Monte Carlo approach, combined with the theory for Markov chains can be summarized as follows:
A Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the simulation of a distribution $w$ is any method producing an 
ergodic Markov chain of events $x$ whose stationary distribution is $w$. The Metropolis algorithm can be phrased as

  * Generate an initial value $x^{(i)}$.

  * Generate a trial value $y_t$ with probability $T(y_t|x^{(i)})$. The latter quantity represents the probability of generating $y_t$ given $x^{(i)}$.

  * Take a new value   
!bt 
\begin{equation*}  
x^{(i+1)}= \left\{\begin{array}{cc} y_t & \mathrm{with\hspace{0.1cm}probability} = A(x^{(i)}\rightarrow y_t) \\                                           x^{(i)}    & \mathrm{with \hspace{0.1cm}probability} = 1-A(x^{(i)}\rightarrow y_t)\end{array}\right .
\end{equation*}
!et 

  * We have defined the transition (acceptance) probability as   
!bt 
\begin{equation*}    A(x\rightarrow y)= \mathrm{min}\left\{\frac{w(y)T(x|y)}{w(x)T(y|x)},1\right\}.
\end{equation*}

===== Boltzmann Machines =====

Why use a generative model rather than the more well known discriminative deep neural networks (DNN)? 

* Discriminitave methods have several limitations: They are mainly supervised learning methods, thus requiring labeled data. And there are tasks they cannot accomplish, like drawing new examples from an unknown probability distribution.

* A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model of the probability distribution from which the training data was drawn. As an example

  o A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.
  o Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered Ising model phase, having been given samples of such phases.
  o Model the trial function for Monte Carlo calculations


!split
===== Some similarities and differences from DNNs =====

 o Both use gradient-descent based learning procedures for minimizing cost functions
 o Energy based models don't use backpropagation and automatic differentiation for computing gradients, instead turning to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
 o DNNs often have several hidden layers. A restricted Boltzmann machine has only one hidden layer, however several RBMs can be stacked to make up Deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute the building blocks.

History: The RBM was developed by amongst others Geoffrey Hinton, called by some the "Godfather of Deep Learning", working with the University of Toronto and Google.


!split
=====  Boltzmann machines (BM) =====

!bblock
A BM is what we would call an undirected probabilistic graphical model
with stochastic continuous or discrete units.
!eblock
!bblock
It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the
state of each unit(neurons/nodes) depends on the units it is connected
to. The weights in the network represent thus the strength of the
interaction between various units/nodes.
!eblock
!bblock
It turns into a Hopfield network if we choose deterministic rather
than stochastic units. In contrast to a Hopfield network, a BM is a
so-called generative model. It allows us to generate new samples from
the learned distribution.
!eblock

!split
===== A standard BM setup =====

!bblock
A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\hat{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\hat{h}$.
!eblock

!bblock
Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.
!eblock

!bblock
BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning
!eblock

However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.
Here we take away all lateral connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections between nodes in the hidden layer. The network is illustrated in the figure below.



!split
===== The structure of the RBM network =====

FIGURE: [figures/RBM.pdf, width=800 frac=1.0]



!split
===== The network =====

_The network layers_:
  o A function $\mathbf{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
  o The function $\mathbf{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".

!split
===== Goals =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized over (integrated out).

Examples of this trick being employed in physics: 
  o The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation
  o The introduction of ghost fields in gauge theory
  o Shadow wave functions in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations
_The network parameters, to be optimized/learned_:
  o $\mathbf{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\mathbf{x}$.
  o $\mathbf{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\mathbf{h}$.
  o $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.




!split
===== Joint distribution =====
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Bolztmann distribution
!bt
\begin{align}
	P_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})},
\end{align}
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
!bt
\begin{align}
	Z = \int \int e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})} d\mathbf{x} d\mathbf{h}.
\end{align}
!et
It is common to ignore $T_0$ by setting it to one. 




!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.

An expression for the energy function is
!bt
\[
E(\hat{x},\hat{h}) = -\sum_{ia}^{NA}b_i^a \alpha_i^a(x_i)-\sum_{jd}^{MD}c_j^d \beta_j^d(h_j)-\sum_{ijad}^{NAMD}b_i^a \alpha_i^a(x_i)c_j^d \beta_j^d(h_j)w_{ij}^{ad}.
\]
!et

Here $\beta_j^d(h_j)$ and $\alpha_i^a(x_j)$ are so-called transfer functions that map a given input value to a desired feature value. The labels $a$ and $d$ denote that there can be multiple transfer functions per variable. The first sum depends only on the visible units. The second on the hidden ones. _Note_ that there is no connection between nodes in a layer.

The quantities $b$ and $c$ can be interpreted as the visible and hidden biases, respectively.

The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs =====
There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\end{align}
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock
!bblock Gaussian-Binary RBM:

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\end{align}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== More about RBMs =====
o Useful when we model continuous data (i.e., we wish $\mathbf{x}$ to be continuous)
o Requires a smaller learning rate, since there's no upper bound to the value a component might take in the reconstruction

Other types of units include:
 o Softmax and multinomial units
 o Gaussian visible and hidden units
 o Binomial units
 o Rectified linear units


!split
===== Sampling: Metropolis sampling =====
In order to sample from the RBM probability distribution it is common to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling.



Metropolis sampling starts by suggesting a new configuration $\bm{x}^{k+1}$. In the brute force method this is done by some random change of the visible units. The new configuration is then accepted with the acceptance probability
!bt
\begin{align}
	A(\bm{x}^k \rightarrow \bm{x}^{k+1}) = \text{min} (1, \frac{P(\bm{x}^{k+1})}{P(\bm{x}^k)}),
\end{align} 
!et
where we need the marginalized probability
!bt
\begin{align}
	P(\bm{x})  &= \sum_\mathbf{h} P_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) \\
				&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_\mathbf{h} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})}.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Grinding through the details =====

More material to come here

!split
===== Sampling: Gibbs sampling =====

In this method we sample from the joint probability $P_{rbm} (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})$ by way of a two step sampling process. We alternately update the visible and hidden units.
New samples are generated according to the conditional probabilities $P(x_i|\mathbf{h})$ and $P(h_j|\mathbf{x})$ respectively and accepted with the probability of $1$. While the the visible nodes are dependent on the hidden nodes and vice versa, the nodes are independent of other nodes within the same layer. This is due to there being no intra layer interactions in the restricted Boltzmann machine.

The conditional probabilities are often referred to as the activitation functions in the neural networks context due to their role in determining the node outputs. For the binary-binary RBM they are
!bt
\begin{align}
	P(h_j = 1 | \bm{x}) &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-b_j - \sum_i x_i w_{ij}}} \\
	P(x_i = 1 | \bm{h}) &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a_j - \sum_j h_j w_{ij}}},
\end{align}
!et
where we recognize the logistic sigmoid function $\sigma (x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))$.

!split
===== Gaussian RBM =====
For the Gaussian-Binary RBM the conditional probabilities are
!bt
\begin{align}
	P(x_i|\mathbf{h}) &= \mathcal{N}(x_i; a_i+ \sum_j h_j w_{ij}, \sigma^2) \\
	P(h_j=1|\mathbf{x}) &=  \frac{1}{1+e^{-b_j-\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_i x_i w_{ij}}},
\end{align}
!et
while the visible units now follow a normal distribution, we see the hidden units again follow the logistic sigmoid function.

!split
===== Cost function =====

When working with a training dataset, the most common training approach is maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data. The log likelihood characterizes the log-probability of generating the observed data using our generative model. Using this method our cost function is chosen as the negative log-likelihood. The learning then consists of trying to find parameters that maximize the probability of the dataset, and is known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
Denoting the parameters as $\bm{\theta} = a_1,...,a_M,b_1,...,b_N,w_{11},...,w_{MN}$, the log-likelihood is given by
!bt
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}(\{ \theta_i \}) &= \langle \text{log} P_\theta(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} \\
	&= - \langle E(\bm{x}; \{ \theta_i\}) \rangle_{data} - \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\}),
\end{align}
!et
where we used that the normalization constant does not depend on the data, $\langle \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\}) \rangle = \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\})$
Our cost function is the negative log-likelihood, $\mathcal{C}(\{ \theta_i \}) = - \mathcal{L}(\{ \theta_i \})$

!split
===== Optimization / Training =====

The training procedure of choice often is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It consists of a series of iterations where we update the parameters according to the equation
!bt
\begin{align}
	\bm{\theta}_{k+1} = \bm{\theta}_k - \eta \nabla \mathcal{C} (\bm{\theta}_k)
\end{align}
!et
at each $k$-th iteration. There are a range of variants of the algorithm which aim at making the learning rate $\eta$ more adaptive so the method might be more efficient while remaining stable.

We now need the gradient of the cost function in order to minimize it. We find that
!bt
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\{ \theta_i\})}{\partial \theta_i}
	&= \langle \frac{\partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i)}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle_{data}
	+ \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\})}{\partial \theta_i} \\
	&= \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model},
\end{align}
!et
where in order to simplify notation we defined the "operator"
!bt
\begin{align}
	O_i(\bm{x}) = \frac{\partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i)}{\partial \theta_i}, 
\end{align}
!et
and used the statistical mechanics relationship between expectation values and the log-partition function:
!bt
\begin{align}
	\langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model} = \text{Tr} P_\theta(\bm{x})O_i(\bm{x}) = - \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\})}{\partial \theta_i}.
\end{align}
!et

!split 
=====  More on RBMs =====

The data-dependent term in the gradient is known as the positive phase of the gradient, while the model-dependent term is known as the negative phase of the gradient. The aim of the training is to lower the energy of configurations that are near observed data points (increasing their probability), and raising the energy of configurations that are far from observed data points (decreasing their probability).

The gradient of the negative log-likelihood cost function of a Binary-Binary RBM is then
!bt
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial w_{ij}} =& \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{model} \\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial a_{ij}} =& \langle x_i \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i \rangle_{model} \\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial b_{ij}} =& \langle h_i \rangle_{data} - \langle h_i \rangle_{model}. \\

To get the expecation values with respect to the *data*, we set the visible units to each of the observed samples in the training data, then update the hidden units according to the conditional probability found before. We then average over all samples in the training data to calculate expectation values with respect to the data. 

!split
===== Which sampling to use =====

To get the expectation values with respect to the *model*, we use Gibbs sampling. We can either initialize the $\bm{x}$ randomly or with a training sample. While we ideally want a large number of Gibbs iterations $n\rightarrow n$, one might decide to truncate it earlier for efficiency. Doing this while having intialized $\bm{x}$ with a training data vector is referred to as contrastive divergence (CD), because one is then closer to approximating the gradient of this function than the negative log-likelihood. The contrastive divergence function is the difference between two Kullback-Leibler divergences (also called relative entropy), which measure how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution (in this case the estimated one from the ground truth one).


!split
===== Kullback-Leibler relative entropy =====

When the goal of the training is to approximate a probability
distribution, as it is in generative modeling, another relevant
measure is the _Kullback-Leibler divergence_, also known as the
relative entropy or Shannon entropy. It is a non-symmetric measure of the
dissimilarity between two probability density functions $p$ and
$q$. If $p$ is the unkown probability which we approximate with $q$,
we can measure the difference by
!bt
\begin{align}
	\text{KL}(p||q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p (\bm{x}) \log \frac{p(\bm{x})}{q(\bm{x})}  d\bm{x}.
\end{align}
!et

Thus, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the
training data $f(\bm{x})$ and the model distribution $p(\bm{x}|
\bm{\theta})$ is

!bt
\begin{align}
	\text{KL} (f(\bm{x})|| p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta})) =& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
	f (\bm{x}) \log \frac{f(\bm{x})}{p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta})} d\bm{x} \\
	=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log f(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log
	p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta}) d\bm{x} \\
	%=& \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log f(\bm{x})) - \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta}))
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} - \langle \log p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \langle E(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \log Z \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \mathcal{C}_{LL} .
\end{align}
!et

The first term is constant with respect to $\bm{\theta}$ since $f(\bm{x})$ is independent of $\bm{\theta}$. Thus the Kullback-Leibler Divergence is minimal when the second term is minimal. The second term is the log-likelihood cost function, hence minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood.

!split
===== Optimizing the cost function =====

To further understand generative models it is useful to study the
gradient of the cost function which is needed in order to minimize it
using methods like stochastic gradient descent. 

The partition function is the generating function of
expectation values, in particular there are mathematical relationships
between expectation values and the log-partition function. In this
case we have
!bt
\begin{align}
	\langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i) } { \partial \theta_i} \rangle_{model}
	= \int p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta}) \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i) } { \partial \theta_i} d\bm{x} 
	= -\frac{\partial \log Z(\theta_i)}{ \partial  \theta_i} .
\end{align}
!et

Here $\langle \cdot \rangle_{model}$ is the expectation value over the model probability distribution $p(\bm{x}| \bm{\theta})$.

!split
===== Setting up for gradient descent calculations =====

Using the previous relationship we can express the gradient of the cost function as

!bt
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}_{LL}}{\partial \theta_i}
	=& \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i) } { \partial \theta_i} \rangle_{data} + \frac{\partial \log Z(\theta_i)}{ \partial  \theta_i} \\
	=& \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i) } { \partial \theta_i} \rangle_{data} - \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \theta_i) } { \partial \theta_i} \rangle_{model} \\
	%=& \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model}
\end{align}
!et

This expression shows that the gradient of the log-likelihood cost
function is a _difference of moments_, with one calculated from
the data and one calculated from the model. The data-dependent term is
called the _positive phase_ and the model-dependent term is
called the _negative phase_ of the gradient. We see now that
minimizing the cost function results in lowering the energy of
configurations $\bm{x}$ near points in the training data and
increasing the energy of configurations not observed in the training
data. That means we increase the model's probability of configurations
similar to those in the training data.

!split
===== More interpretations =====

The gradient of the cost function also demonstrates why gradients of
unsupervised, generative models must be computed differently from for
those of for example FNNs. While the data-dependent expectation value
is easily calculated based on the samples $\bm{x}_i$ in the training
data, we must sample from the model in order to generate samples from
which to caclulate the model-dependent term. We sample from the model
by using MCMC-based methods. We can not sample from the model directly
because the partition function $Z$ is generally intractable.

As in supervised machine learning problems, the goal is also here to
perform well on _unseen_ data, that is to have good
generalization from the training data. The distribution $f(x)$ we
approximate is not the _true_ distribution we wish to estimate,
it is limited to the training data. Hence, in unsupervised training as
well it is important to prevent overfitting to the training data. Thus
it is common to add regularizers to the cost function in the same
manner as we discussed for say linear regression.

===== Recent examples: RBMs for the quantum many body problem =====

The idea of applying RBMs to quantum many body problems was presented by G. Carleo and M. Troyer, working with ETH Zurich and Microsoft Research.

Some of their motivation included

* "The wave function $\Psi$ is a monolithic mathematical quantity that contains all the information on a quantum state, be it a single particle or a complex molecule. In principle, an exponential amount of information is needed to fully encode a generic many-body quantum state."
* There are still interesting open problems, including fundamental questions ranging from the dynamical properties of high-dimensional systems to the exact ground-state properties of strongly interacting fermions.
* The difficulty lies in finding a general strategy to reduce the exponential complexity of the full many-body wave function down to its most essential features. That is
 o $\rightarrow$ Dimensional reduction
 o $\rightarrow$ Feature extraction
* Among the most successful techniques to attack these challenges, artifical neural networks play a prominent role.
* Want to understand whether an artifical neural network may adapt to describe a quantum system.

===== Choose the right RBM ===== 

Carleo and Troyer applied the RBM to the quantum mechanical spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with encouraging results. Our goal is to test the method on systems of moving particles. For the spin lattice systems it was natural to use a binary-binary RBM, with the nodes taking values of 1 and -1. For moving particles, on the other hand, we want the visible nodes to be continuous, representing position coordinates. Thus, we start by choosing a Gaussian-binary RBM, where the visible nodes are continuous and hidden nodes take on values of 0 or 1. If eventually we would like the hidden nodes to be continuous as well the rectified linear units seem like the most relevant choice.



!split
===== Representing the wave function =====
The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on $\bm{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint\
 distribution of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$
!bt
\begin{align}
        F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})}.
\end{align}
!et
To find the marginal distribution of $\bm{x}$ we set:
!bt
\begin{align}
        F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) &= \sum_\mathbf{h} F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) \\
                                &= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_\mathbf{h} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})}.
\end{align}
!et

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
!bt
\begin{align}
        \Psi (\mathbf{X}) &= F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) \\
        &= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\bm{h}} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})} \\
        &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\{h_j\}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_\
{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}} \\
        &= \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \sum_i^M \frac{x\
_i w_{ij}}{\sigma^2}}). \\
\end{align}
!et


!split
===== Choose the cost function =====
Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction (corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent procedure is
!bt
\begin{align}
	G_i = \frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\end{align}
!et
where the local energy is given by
!bt
\begin{align}
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\mathbf{H}} \Psi.
\end{align}
!et

===== Running the codes =====
!bblock
You can find the codes for the simple two-electron case at the Github repository URL:"https://github.com/mhjensenseminars/MachineLearningTalk/tree/master/doc/Programs/MLcpp/src". Python codes to come, only c++ as of now. 

The trial wave function is based on the product of a Slater determinant with Gaussian orbitals, a simple Jastrow factor $\exp{(r_{ij})}$ and the reduced Boltzmann machines. 

The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm was used to perform the minimization. We used $14$ hidden nodes in the calculations below.
