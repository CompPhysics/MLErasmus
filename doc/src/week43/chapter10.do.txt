===== Recurrent neural networks: Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

=====  An extrapolation example =====

The following code provides an example of how recurrent neural
networks can be used to extrapolate to unknown values of physics data
sets.  Specifically, the data sets used in this program come from
a quantum mechanical many-body calculation of energies as functions of the number of particles.

===== Formatting the Data =====

The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program
differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.
Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the
relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the
recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship
in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is
typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any
extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of
extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting
does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.

For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the
form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a
y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x
values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this
application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values
of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine
learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the
recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the
form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning
the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y
data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region
stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training
region, this method of training can produce accurate extrapolations to
y values far removed from the training data set.


# 
# The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html).
# 
# The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the "x data" are of the form (y1, y2) and the "y data" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow.
# 
# Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points.

===== Other Things to Try =====


Changing the size of the recurrent neural network and its parameters
can drastically change the results you get from the model.  The below
code takes the simple recurrent neural network from above and adds a
second hidden layer, changes the number of neurons in the hidden
layer, and explicitly declares the activation function of the hidden
layers to be a sigmoid function.  The loss function and optimizer can
also be changed but are kept the same as the above network.  These
parameters can be tuned to provide the optimal result from the
network.  For some ideas on how to improve the performance of a

===== Other Types of Recurrent Neural Networks =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".

The first network created below is similar to the previous network,
but it replaces the SimpleRNN layers with LSTM layers.  The second
network below has two hidden layers made up of GRUs, which are
preceeded by two dense (feeddorward) neural network layers.  These
dense layers "preprocess" the data before it reaches the recurrent
layers.  This architecture has been shown to improve the performance
of recurrent neural networks (see the link above and also
URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02857.pdf".

======= Solving ODEs with Deep Learning =======

The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a neural network can
approximate any function at a single hidden layer along with one input
and output layer to any given precision.  



===== Ordinary Differential Equations =====

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation involving functions having one variable.

In general, an ordinary differential equation looks like

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{ode}
f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right) = 0
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(x)$ is the function to find, and $g^{(n)}(x)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $g(x)$.

The $f\left(x, g(x), g'(x), g''(x), \, \dots \, , g^{(n)}(x)\right)$ is just a way to write that there is an expression involving $x$ and $g(x), \ g'(x), \ g''(x), \, \dots \, , \text{ and } g^{(n)}(x)$ on the left side of the equality sign in (ref{ode}).
The highest order of derivative, that is the value of $n$, determines to the order of the equation.
The equation is referred to as a $n$-th order ODE.
Along with (ref{ode}), some additional conditions of the function $g(x)$ are typically given
for the solution to be unique.


===== The trial solution =====

Let the trial solution $g_t(x)$ be

!bt
\begin{equation}
	g_t(x) = h_1(x) + h_2(x,N(x,P))
\end{equation}
!et


where $h_1(x)$ is a function that makes $g_t(x)$ satisfy a given set
of conditions, $N(x,P)$ a neural network with weights and biases
described by $P$ and $h_2(x, N(x,P))$ some expression involving the
neural network.  The role of the function $h_2(x, N(x,P))$, is to
ensure that the output from $N(x,P)$ is zero when $g_t(x)$ is
evaluated at the values of $x$ where the given conditions must be
satisfied.  The function $h_1(x)$ should alone make $g_t(x)$ satisfy
the conditions.

But what about the network $N(x,P)$?


As described previously, an optimization method could be used to minimize the parameters of a neural network, that being its weights and biases, through backward propagation.



===== Minimization process =====

For the minimization to be defined, we need to have a cost function at hand to minimize.

It is given that $f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right)$ should be equal to zero in (ref{ode}).
We can choose to consider the mean squared error as the cost function for an input $x$.
Since we are looking at one input, the cost function is just $f$ squared.
The cost function $c\left(x, P \right)$ can therefore be expressed as

!bt
C\left(x, P\right) = \big(f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right)\big)^2
!et

If $N$ inputs are given as a vector $\bm{x}$ with elements $x_i$ for $i = 1,\dots,N$,
the cost function becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{cost}
	C\left(\bm{x}, P\right) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \big(f\left(x_i, \, g(x_i), \, g'(x_i), \, g''(x_i), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x_i)\right)\big)^2
\end{equation}
!et

The neural net should then find the parameters $P$ that minimizes the cost function in
(ref{cost}) for a set of $N$ training samples $x_i$.


===== Minimizing the cost function using gradient descent and automatic differentiation =====

To perform the minimization using gradient descent, the gradient of $C\left(\bm{x}, P\right)$ is needed.
It might happen so that finding an analytical expression of the gradient of $C(\bm{x}, P)$ from (ref{cost}) gets too messy, depending on which cost function one desires to use.

Luckily, there exists libraries that makes the job for us through automatic differentiation.
Automatic differentiation is a method of finding the derivatives numerically with very high precision.



===== Example: Exponential decay =====

An exponential decay of a quantity $g(x)$ is described by the equation

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solve_expdec}
  g'(x) = -\gamma g(x)
\end{equation}
!et

with $g(0) = g_0$ for some chosen initial value $g_0$.

The analytical solution of (ref{solve_expdec}) is

!bt
\begin{equation}
  g(x) = g_0 \exp\left(-\gamma x\right)
\end{equation}
!et

Having an analytical solution at hand, it is possible to use it to compare how well a neural network finds a solution of (ref{solve_expdec}).



===== The function to solve for =====

The program will use a neural network to solve

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solveode}
g'(x) = -\gamma g(x)
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(0) = g_0$ with $\gamma$ and $g_0$ being some chosen values.

In this example, $\gamma = 2$ and $g_0 = 10$.


===== The trial solution =====
To begin with, a trial solution $g_t(t)$ must be chosen. A general trial solution for ordinary differential equations could be

!bt
g_t(x, P) = h_1(x) + h_2(x, N(x, P))
!et

with $h_1(x)$ ensuring that $g_t(x)$ satisfies some conditions and $h_2(x,N(x, P))$ an expression involving $x$ and the output from the neural network $N(x,P)$ with $P $ being the collection of the weights and biases for each layer. For now, it is assumed that the network consists of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.


===== Setup of Network =====

In this network, there are no weights and bias at the input layer, so $P = \{ P_{\text{hidden}},  P_{\text{output}} \}$.
If there are $N_{\text{hidden} }$ neurons in the hidden layer, then $P_{\text{hidden}}$ is a $N_{\text{hidden} } \times (1 + N_{\text{input}})$ matrix, given that there are $N_{\text{input}}$ neurons in the input layer.

The first column in $P_{\text{hidden} }$ represents the bias for each neuron in the hidden layer and the second column represents the weights for each neuron in the hidden layer from the input layer.
If there are $N_{\text{output} }$ neurons in the output layer, then $P_{\text{output}} $ is a $N_{\text{output} } \times (1 + N_{\text{hidden} })$ matrix.

Its first column represents the bias of each neuron and the remaining columns represents the weights to each neuron.

It is given that $g(0) = g_0$. The trial solution must fulfill this condition to be a proper solution of (ref{solveode}). A possible way to ensure that $g_t(0, P) = g_0$, is to let $F(N(x,P)) = x \cdot N(x,P)$ and $A(x) = g_0$. This gives the following trial solution:

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{trial}
g_t(x, P) = g_0 + x \cdot N(x, P)
\end{equation}
!et


===== Reformulating the problem =====

We wish that our neural network manages to minimize a given cost function.

A reformulation of out equation, (ref{solveode}), must therefore be done,
such that it describes the problem a neural network can solve for.

The neural network must find the set of weights and biases $P$ such that the trial solution in (ref{trial}) satisfies (ref{solveode}).

The trial solution

!bt
g_t(x, P) = g_0 + x \cdot N(x, P)
!et

has been chosen such that it already solves the condition $g(0) = g_0$. What remains, is to find $P$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{nnmin}
g_t'(x, P) = - \gamma g_t(x, P)
\end{equation}
!et

is fulfilled as *best as possible*.


===== More technicalities =====

The left hand side and right hand side of (ref{nnmin}) must be computed separately, and then the neural network must choose weights and biases, contained in $P$, such that the sides are equal as best as possible.
This means that the absolute or squared difference between the sides must be as close to zero, ideally equal to zero.
In this case, the difference squared shows to be an appropriate measurement of how erroneous the trial solution is with respect to $P$ of the neural network.

This gives the following cost function our neural network must solve for:

!bt
\min_{P}\Big\{ \big(g_t'(x, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x, P) \big)^2 \Big\}
!et

(the notation $\min_{P}\{ f(x, P) \}$ means that we desire to find $P$ that yields the minimum of $f(x, P)$)

or, in terms of weights and biases for the hidden and output layer in our network:

!bt
\min_{P_{\text{hidden} }, \ P_{\text{output} }}\Big\{ \big(g_t'(x, \{ P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\}) - ( -\gamma g_t(x, \{ P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\}) \big)^2 \Big\}
!et

for an input value $x$.


=====  More details =====

If the neural network evaluates $g_t(x, P)$ at more values for $x$, say $N$ values $x_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, N$, then the *total* error to minimize becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{min}
\min_{P}\Big\{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2 \Big\}
\end{equation}
!et

Letting $\bm{x}$ be a vector with elements $x_i$ and $C(\bm{x}, P) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2$ denote the cost function, the minimization problem that our network must solve, becomes

!bt
\min_{P} C(\bm{x}, P)
!et

In terms of $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and $P_{\text{output} }$, this could also be expressed as

$$
\min_{P_{\text{hidden} }, \ P_{\text{output} }} C(\bm{x}, \{P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\})
$$


===== A possible implementation of a neural network =====

For simplicity, it is assumed that the input is an array $\bm{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_N)$ with $N$ elements. It is at these points the neural network should find $P$ such that it fulfills (ref{min}).

First, the neural network must feed forward the inputs.
This means that $\bm{x}s$ must be passed through an input layer, a hidden layer and a output layer. The input layer in this case, does not need to process the data any further.
The input layer will consist of $N_{\text{input} }$ neurons, passing its element to each neuron in the hidden layer.  The number of neurons in the hidden layer will be $N_{\text{hidden} }$.


===== Technicalities =====

For the $i$-th in the hidden layer with weight $w_i^{\text{hidden} }$ and bias $b_i^{\text{hidden} }$, the weighting from the $j$-th neuron at the input layer is:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
z_{i,j}^{\text{hidden}} &= b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}}x_j \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
b_i^{\text{hidden}} & w_i^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
x_j
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
!et


=====  Final technicalities I =====

The result after weighting the inputs at the $i$-th hidden neuron can be written as a vector:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
\bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} &= \Big( b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}}x_1 , \ b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}} x_2, \ \dots \, , \ b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}} x_N\Big)  \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
 b_i^{\text{hidden}}  & w_i^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_N
\end{pmatrix} \\
&= \bm{p}_{i, \text{hidden}}^T X
\end{aligned}
!et


=====  Final technicalities II =====

The vector $\bm{p}_{i, \text{hidden}}^T$ constitutes each row in $P_{\text{hidden} }$, which contains the weights for the neural network to minimize according to (ref{min}).

After having found $\bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} $ for every $i$-th neuron within the hidden layer, the vector will be sent to an activation function $a_i(\bm{z})$.

In this example, the sigmoid function has been chosen to be the activation function for each hidden neuron:

!bt
f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{(-z)}}
!et

It is possible to use other activations functions for the hidden layer also.

The output $\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden}}$ from each $i$-th hidden neuron is:

$$
\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden} } = f\big(  \bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} \big)
$$

The outputs $\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden} } $ are then sent to the output layer.

The output layer consists of one neuron in this case, and combines the
output from each of the neurons in the hidden layers. The output layer
combines the results from the hidden layer using some weights $w_i^{\text{output}}$
and biases $b_i^{\text{output}}$. In this case,
it is assumes that the number of neurons in the output layer is one.


=====  Final technicalities III =====


The procedure of weighting the output neuron $j$ in the hidden layer to the $i$-th neuron in the output layer is similar as for the hidden layer described previously.

!bt
\begin{aligned}
z_{1,j}^{\text{output}} & =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1^{\text{output}} & \bm{w}_1^{\text{output}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
\bm{x}_j^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
!et


=====  Final technicalities IV =====

Expressing $z_{1,j}^{\text{output}}$ as a vector gives the following way of weighting the inputs from the hidden layer:

!bt
\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1^{\text{output}} & \bm{w}_1^{\text{output}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
\bm{x}_1^{\text{hidden}} & \bm{x}_2^{\text{hidden}} & \dots & \bm{x}_N^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
!et

In this case we seek a continuous range of values since we are approximating a function. This means that after computing $\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}}$ the neural network has finished its feed forward step, and $\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}}$ is the final output of the network.


===== Back propagation =====

The next step is to decide how the parameters should be changed such that they minimize the cost function.

The chosen cost function for this problem is

!bt
C(\bm{x}, P) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2
!et

In order to minimize the cost function, an optimization method must be chosen.

Here, gradient descent with a constant step size has been chosen.


===== Gradient descent =====

The idea of the gradient descent algorithm is to update parameters in
a direction where the cost function decreases goes to a minimum.

In general, the update of some parameters $\bm{\omega}$ given a cost
function defined by some weights $\bm{\omega}$, $C(\bm{x},
\bm{\omega})$, goes as follows:

!bt
\bm{\omega}_{\text{new} } = \bm{\omega} - \lambda \nabla_{\bm{\omega}} C(\bm{x}, \bm{\omega})
!et

for a number of iterations or until $ \big|\big| \bm{\omega}_{\text{new} } - \bm{\omega} \big|\big|$ becomes smaller than some given tolerance.

The value of $\lambda$ decides how large steps the algorithm must take
in the direction of $ \nabla_{\bm{\omega}} C(\bm{x}, \bm{\omega})$.
The notation $\nabla_{\bm{\omega}}$ express the gradient with respect
to the elements in $\bm{\omega}$.

In our case, we have to minimize the cost function $C(\bm{x}, P)$ with
respect to the two sets of weights and biases, that is for the hidden
layer $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and for the output layer $P_{\text{output}
}$ .

This means that $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and $P_{\text{output} }$ is updated by

!bt
\begin{aligned}
P_{\text{hidden},\text{new}} &= P_{\text{hidden}} - \lambda \nabla_{P_{\text{hidden}}} C(\bm{x}, P)  \\
P_{\text{output},\text{new}} &= P_{\text{output}} - \lambda \nabla_{P_{\text{output}}} C(\bm{x}, P)
\end{aligned}
!et

===== Example: Population growth =====

A logistic model of population growth assumes that a population converges toward an equilibrium.
The population growth can be modeled by

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{log}
	g'(t) = \alpha g(t)(A - g(t))
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(t)$ is the population density at time $t$, $\alpha > 0$ the growth rate and $A > 0$ is the maximum population number in the environment.
Also, at $t = 0$ the population has the size $g(0) = g_0$, where $g_0$ is some chosen constant.

In this example, similar network as for the exponential decay using Autograd has been used to solve the equation. However, as the implementation might suffer from e.g numerical instability
and high execution time (this might be more apparent in the examples solving PDEs),
using a library like  TensorFlow is recommended.
Here, we stay with a more simple approach and implement for comparison, the simple forward Euler method.


===== Setting up the problem =====

Here, we will model a population $g(t)$ in an environment having carrying capacity $A$.
The population follows the model

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solveode_population}
g'(t) = \alpha g(t)(A - g(t))
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(0) = g_0$.

In this example, we let $\alpha = 2$, $A = 1$, and $g_0 = 1.2$.


===== The trial solution =====

We will get a slightly different trial solution, as the boundary conditions are different
compared to the case for exponential decay.

A possible trial solution satisfying the condition $g(0) = g_0$ could be

$$
h_1(t) = g_0 + t \cdot N(t,P)
$$

with $N(t,P)$ being the output from the neural network with weights and biases for each layer collected in the set $P$.

The analytical solution is

$$
g(t) = \frac{Ag_0}{g_0 + (A - g_0)\exp(-\alpha A t)}
$$


===== The program using Autograd =====

The network will be the similar as for the exponential decay example, but with some small modifications for our problem.

===== Using forward Euler to solve the ODE =====

A straightforward way of solving an ODE numerically, is to use Euler's method.

Euler's method uses Taylor series to approximate the value at a function $f$ at a step $\Delta x$ from $x$:

$$
f(x + \Delta x) \approx f(x) + \Delta x f'(x)
$$

In our case, using Euler's method to approximate the value of $g$ at a step $\Delta t$ from $t$ yields

!bt
\begin{aligned}
  g(t + \Delta t) &\approx g(t) + \Delta t g'(t) \\
  &= g(t) + \Delta t \big(\alpha g(t)(A - g(t))\big)
\end{aligned}
!et
along with the condition that $g(0) = g_0$.

Let $t_i = i \cdot \Delta t$ where $\Delta t = \frac{T}{N_t-1}$ where $T$ is the final time our solver must solve for and $N_t$ the number of values for $t \in [0, T]$ for $i = 0, \dots, N_t-1$.

For $i \geq 1$, we have that
!bt
\begin{aligned}
t_i &= i\Delta t \\
&= (i - 1)\Delta t + \Delta t \\
&= t_{i-1} + \Delta t
\end{aligned}
!et

Now, if $g_i = g(t_i)$ then

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  g_i &= g(t_i) \\
  &= g(t_{i-1} + \Delta t) \\
  &\approx g(t_{i-1}) + \Delta t \big(\alpha g(t_{i-1})(A - g(t_{i-1}))\big) \\
  &= g_{i-1} + \Delta t \big(\alpha g_{i-1}(A - g_{i-1})\big)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} \label{odenum}
!et
for $i \geq 1$ and $g_0 = g(t_0) = g(0) = g_0$.

Equation (ref{odenum}) could be implemented in the following way,
extending the program that uses the network using Autograd:

!bc pycod
# Assume that all function definitions from the example program using Autograd
# are located here.

===== Example: Solving the one dimensional Poisson equation =====

The Poisson equation for $g(x)$ in one dimension is

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{poisson}
  -g''(x) = f(x)
\end{equation}
!et

where $f(x)$ is a given function for $x \in (0,1)$.

The conditions that $g(x)$ is chosen to fulfill, are
!bt
\begin{align*}
  g(0) &= 0 \\
  g(1) &= 0
\end{align*}
!et

This equation can be solved numerically using programs where e.g Autograd and TensorFlow are used.
The results from the networks can then be compared to the analytical solution.
In addition, it could be interesting to see how a typical method for numerically solving second order ODEs compares to the neural networks.


===== The specific equation to solve for =====

Here, the function $g(x)$ to solve for follows the equation

!bt
-g''(x) = f(x),\qquad x \in (0,1)
!et

where $f(x)$ is a given function, along with the chosen conditions

!bt
\begin{aligned}
g(0) = g(1) = 0
\end{aligned}\label{cond}
!et

In this example, we consider the case when $f(x) = (3x + x^2)\exp(x)$.

For this case, a possible trial solution satisfying the conditions could be

!bt
g_t(x) = x \cdot (1-x) \cdot N(P,x)
!et

The analytical solution for this problem is

!bt
g(x) = x(1 - x)\exp(x)
!et

===== Comparing with a numerical scheme =====

The Poisson equation is possible to solve using Taylor series to approximate the second derivative.

Using Taylor series, the second derivative can be expressed as

$$
g''(x) = \frac{g(x + \Delta x) - 2g(x) + g(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2} + E_{\Delta x}(x)
$$

where $\Delta x$ is a small step size and $E_{\Delta x}(x)$ being the error term.

Looking away from the error terms gives an approximation to the second derivative:

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{approx}
g''(x) \approx \frac{g(x + \Delta x) - 2g(x) + g(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
\end{equation}
!et

If $x_i = i \Delta x = x_{i-1} + \Delta x$ and $g_i = g(x_i)$ for $i = 1,\dots N_x - 2$ with $N_x$ being the number of values for $x$, (ref{approx}) becomes

!bt
\begin{aligned}
g''(x_i) &\approx \frac{g(x_i + \Delta x) - 2g(x_i) + g(x_i -\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2} \\
&= \frac{g_{i+1} - 2g_i + g_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}
\end{aligned}
!et

Since we know from our problem that

!bt
\begin{aligned}
-g''(x) &= f(x) \\
&= (3x + x^2)\exp(x)
\end{aligned}
!et

along with the conditions $g(0) = g(1) = 0$,
the following scheme can be used to find an approximate solution for $g(x)$ numerically:

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  -\Big( \frac{g_{i+1} - 2g_i + g_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} \Big) &= f(x_i) \\
  -g_{i+1} + 2g_i - g_{i-1} &= \Delta x^2 f(x_i)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} \label{odesys}
!et

for $i = 1, \dots, N_x - 2$ where $g_0 = g_{N_x - 1} = 0$ and $f(x_i) = (3x_i + x_i^2)\exp(x_i)$, which is given for our specific problem.

The equation can be rewritten into a matrix equation:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & -1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\
0 & \dots & -1 & 2 & -1  \\
0 & \dots & 0 & -1 & 2\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
g_1 \\
g_2 \\
\vdots \\
g_{N_x - 3} \\
g_{N_x - 2}
\end{pmatrix}
&=
\Delta x^2
\begin{pmatrix}
f(x_1) \\
f(x_2) \\
\vdots \\
f(x_{N_x - 3}) \\
f(x_{N_x - 2})
\end{pmatrix} \\
\bm{A}\bm{g} &= \bm{f},
\end{aligned}
!et

which makes it possible to solve for the vector $\bm{g}$.

===== Partial Differential Equations =====

A partial differential equation (PDE) has a solution here the function
is defined by multiple variables.  The equation may involve all kinds
of combinations of which variables the function is differentiated with
respect to.

In general, a partial differential equation for a function $g(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ with $N$ variables may be expressed as

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{PDE}
  f\left(x_1, \, \dots \, , x_N, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) = 0
\end{equation}
!et

where $f$ is an expression involving all kinds of possible mixed derivatives of $g(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ up to an order $n$. In order for the solution to be unique, some additional conditions must also be given.


===== Type of problem =====

The problem our network must solve for, is similar to the ODE case.
We must have a trial solution $g_t$ at hand.

For instance, the trial solution could be expressed as
!bt
\begin{align*}
  g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N) = h_1(x_1,\dots,x_N) + h_2(x_1,\dots,x_N,N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P))
\end{align*}
!et
where $h_1(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ is a function that ensures $g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ satisfies some given conditions.
The neural network $N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P)$ has weights and biases described by $P$ and $h_2(x_1,\dots,x_N,N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P))$ is an expression using the output from the neural network in some way.

The role of the function $h_2(x_1,\dots,x_N,N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P))$, is to ensure that the output of $N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P)$ is zero when $g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ is evaluated at the values of $x_1,\dots,x_N$ where the given conditions must be satisfied. The function $h_1(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ should alone make $g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ satisfy the conditions.



===== Network requirements =====

The network tries then the minimize the cost function following the
same ideas as described for the ODE case, but now with more than one
variables to consider.  The concept still remains the same; find a set
of parameters $P$ such that the expression $f$ in (ref{PDE}) is as
close to zero as possible.

As for the ODE case, the cost function is the mean squared error that
the network must try to minimize. The cost function for the network to
minimize is

!bt
\begin{equation*}
C\left(x_1, \dots, x_N, P\right) = \left(  f\left(x_1, \, \dots \, , x_N, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) \right)^2
\end{equation*}
!et


===== More details =====

If we let $\bm{x} = \big( x_1, \dots, x_N \big)$ be an array containing the values for $x_1, \dots, x_N$ respectively, the cost function can be reformulated into the following:
!bt
\[
	C\left(\bm{x}, P\right) = f\left( \left( \bm{x}, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) \right)^2
\]
!et

If we also have $M$ different sets of values for $x_1, \dots, x_N$, that is $\bm{x}_i = \big(x_1^{(i)}, \dots, x_N^{(i)}\big)$ for $i = 1,\dots,M$ being the rows in matrix $X$, the cost function can be generalized into
!bt
\begin{equation*}
C\left(X, P \right) = \sum_{i=1}^M f\left( \left( \bm{x}_i, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) \right)^2.
\end{equation*}
!et


===== Example: The diffusion equation =====

In one spatial dimension, the equation reads
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation*}
!et

where a possible choice of conditions are
!bt
\begin{align*}
g(0,t) &= 0 ,\qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(1,t) &= 0, \qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(x,0) &= u(x),\qquad x\in [0,1]
\end{align*}
!et
with $u(x)$ being some given function.


===== Defining the problem =====

For this case, we want to find $g(x,t)$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation} \label{diffonedim}
!et

and

!bt
\begin{align*}
g(0,t) &= 0 ,\qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(1,t) &= 0, \qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(x,0) &= u(x),\qquad x\in [0,1]
\end{align*}
!et
with $u(x) = \sin(\pi x)$.

First, let us set up the deep neural network.
The deep neural network will follow the same structure as discussed in the examples solving the ODEs.
First, we will look into how Autograd could be used in a network tailored to solve for bivariate functions.




===== Setting up the network using Autograd =====

The only change to do here, is to extend our network such that
functions of multiple parameters are correctly handled.  In this case
we have two variables in our function to solve for, that is time $t$
and position $x$.  The variables will be represented by a
one-dimensional array in the program.  The program will evaluate the
network at each possible pair $(x,t)$, given an array for the desired
$x$-values and $t$-values to approximate the solution at.

    return 1/(1 + np.exp(-z))

def deep_neural_network(deep_params, x):
    # x is now a point and a 1D numpy array; make it a column vector
    num_coordinates = np.size(x,0)
    x = x.reshape(num_coordinates,-1)

    num_points = np.size(x,1)

    # N_hidden is the number of hidden layers
    N_hidden = np.size(deep_params) - 1 # -1 since params consist of parameters to all the hidden layers AND the output layer

    # Assume that the input layer does nothing to the input x
    x_input = x
    x_prev = x_input

    ## Hidden layers:

    for l in range(N_hidden):
        # From the list of parameters P; find the correct weigths and bias for this layer
        w_hidden = deep_params[l]

        # Add a row of ones to include bias
        x_prev = np.concatenate((np.ones((1,num_points)), x_prev ), axis = 0)

        z_hidden = np.matmul(w_hidden, x_prev)
        x_hidden = sigmoid(z_hidden)

        # Update x_prev such that next layer can use the output from this layer
        x_prev = x_hidden

    ## Output layer:

    # Get the weights and bias for this layer
    w_output = deep_params[-1]

    # Include bias:
    x_prev = np.concatenate((np.ones((1,num_points)), x_prev), axis = 0)

    z_output = np.matmul(w_output, x_prev)
    x_output = z_output

    return x_output[0][0]
!ec


===== Setting up the network using Autograd; The trial solution =====

The cost function must then iterate through the given arrays
containing values for $x$ and $t$, defines a point $(x,t)$ the deep
neural network and the trial solution is evaluated at, and then finds
the Jacobian of the trial solution.

A possible trial solution for this PDE is

$$
g_t(x,t) = h_1(x,t) + x(1-x)tN(x,t,P)
$$

with $A(x,t)$ being a function ensuring that $g_t(x,t)$ satisfies our given conditions, and $N(x,t,P)$ being the output from the deep neural network using weights and biases for each layer from $P$.

To fulfill the conditions, $A(x,t)$ could be:

$$
h_1(x,t) = (1-t)\Big(u(x) - \big((1-x)u(0) + x u(1)\big)\Big) = (1-t)u(x) = (1-t)\sin(\pi x)
$$
since $(0) = u(1) = 0$ and $u(x) = \sin(\pi x)$.


===== Why the jacobian? =====

The Jacobian is used because the program must find the derivative of
the trial solution with respect to $x$ and $t$.

This gives the necessity of computing the Jacobian matrix, as we want
to evaluate the gradient with respect to $x$ and $t$ (note that the
Jacobian of a scalar-valued multivariate function is simply its
gradient).

In Autograd, the differentiation is by default done with respect to
the first input argument of your Python function. Since the points is
an array representing $x$ and $t$, the Jacobian is calculated using
the values of $x$ and $t$.

To find the second derivative with respect to $x$ and $t$, the
Jacobian can be found for the second time. The result is a Hessian
matrix, which is the matrix containing all the possible second order
mixed derivatives of $g(x,t)$.

            err_sqr = ( (g_t_dt - g_t_d2x) - func)**2
            cost_sum += err_sqr

    return cost_sum
!ec


===== Setting up the network using Autograd; The full program =====

Having set up the network, along with the trial solution and cost function, we can now see how the deep neural network performs by comparing the results to the analytical solution.

The analytical solution of our problem is

$$
g(x,t) = \exp(-\pi^2 t)\sin(\pi x)
$$

A possible way to implement a neural network solving the PDE, is given below.
Be aware, though, that it is fairly slow for the parameters used.
A better result is possible, but requires more iterations, and thus longer time to complete.


Indeed, the program below is not optimal in its implementation, but rather serves as an example on how to implement and use a neural network to solve a PDE.
Using TensorFlow results in a much better execution time. Try it!

===== Example: Solving the wave equation with Neural Networks =====

The wave equation is
!bt
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = c^2\frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation*}
!et

with $c$ being the specified wave speed.

Here, the chosen conditions are
!bt
\begin{align*}
	g(0,t) &= 0 \\
	g(1,t) &= 0 \\
	g(x,0) &= u(x) \\
	\frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} \Big |_{t = 0} &= v(x)
\end{align*}
!et
where $\frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} \Big |_{t = 0}$ means the derivative of $g(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ is evaluated at $t = 0$, and $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ being given functions.


===== The problem to solve for =====

The wave equation to solve for, is

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{wave}
\frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}
!et

where $c$ is the given wave speed.
The chosen conditions for this equation are

!bt
\begin{aligned}
g(0,t) &= 0, &t \geq 0 \\
g(1,t) &= 0, &t \geq 0 \\
g(x,0) &= u(x), &x\in[0,1] \\
\frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t}\Big |_{t = 0} &= v(x), &x \in [0,1]
\end{aligned} \label{condwave}
!et

In this example, let $c = 1$ and $u(x) = \sin(\pi x)$ and $v(x) = -\pi\sin(\pi x)$.



===== The trial solution =====
Setting up the network is done in similar matter as for the example of solving the diffusion equation.
The only things we have to change, is the trial solution such that it satisfies the conditions from (ref{condwave}) and the cost function.

The trial solution becomes slightly different since we have other conditions than in the example of solving the diffusion equation. Here, a possible trial solution $g_t(x,t)$ is

$$
g_t(x,t) = h_1(x,t) + x(1-x)t^2N(x,t,P)
$$

where

$$
h_1(x,t) = (1-t^2)u(x) + tv(x)
$$

Note that this trial solution satisfies the conditions only if $u(0) = v(0) = u(1) = v(1) = 0$, which is the case in this example.


===== The analytical solution =====

The analytical solution for our specific problem, is

$$
g(x,t) = \sin(\pi x)\cos(\pi t) - \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi t)
$$
