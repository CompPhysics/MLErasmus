===== An Overview of Ensemble Methods  =====

!split
===== Bagging =====

The _plain_ decision trees suffer from high
variance. This means that if we split the training data into two parts
at random, and fit a decision tree to both halves, the results that we
get could be quite different. In contrast, a procedure with low
variance will yield similar results if applied repeatedly to distinct
data sets; linear regression tends to have low variance, if the ratio
of $n$ to $p$ is moderately large. 

_Bootstrap aggregation_, or just _bagging_, is a
general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical
learning method. 


!split
===== More bagging =====

Bagging typically results in improved accuracy
over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be
difficult to interpret the resulting model. Recall that one of the
advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted
diagram that results.

However, when we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer
possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure
using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are
most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction
accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection
of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single
tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each
predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini
index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging
regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is
decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible
trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in
the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total
amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given
predictor, averaged over all $B$ trees.



!split
=====  Making your own Bootstrap: Changing the Level of the Decision Tree =====

Let us bring up our good old boostrap example from the linear regression lectures. We change the linerar regression algorithm with
a decision tree wth different depths and perform a bootstrap aggregate (in this case we perform as many bootstraps as data points $n$).

!split
=====  Why Voting? =====

The idea behind boosting, and voting as well can be phrased as follows:
_Can a group of people somehow arrive at highly
reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgement of the individual
members?_

The aim is to create a good classifier by combining several weak classifiers.
_A weak classifier is a classifier which is able to produce results that are only slightly better than guessing at random._

The basic approach is to apply repeatedly (in boosting this is done in an iterative way) a weak classifier to modifications of the data.
In voting we simply apply the law of large numbers while in boosting we give more weight to misclassified data in
each iteration.  

Decision trees play an important role as our weak classifier. They serve as the basic method. 

!split
===== Tossing coins =====

The simplest case is a so-called voting ensemble. To illustrate this,
think of yourself tossing coins with a biased outcome of 51 per cent
for heads and 49% for tails. With only few tosses,
you may not clearly see this distribution for heads and tails. However, after some
thousands of tosses, there will be a clear majority of heads.  With 2000 tosses
you should see approximately 1020 heads and 980 tails.

We can then state that the outcome is a clear majority of heads. If
you do this ten thousand times, it is easy to see that there is a 97%
likelihood of a majority of heads.

Another example would be to collect all polls before an
election. Different polls may show different likelihoods for a
candidate winning with say a majority  of the popular vote. The majority vote
would then consist in many polls indicating that this candidate will
actually win.

The example here shows how we can implement the coin tossing case,
clealry demostrating that after some tosses we see the "law of large":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers"
numbers kicking in.

!split
===== Random forests =====

Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a
small tweak that decorrelates the trees. 

As in bagging, we build a
number of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when
building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is
considered, a random sample of $m$ predictors is chosen as split
candidates from the full set of $p$ predictors. The split is allowed to
use only one of those $m$ predictors. 

A fresh sample of $m$ predictors is
taken at each split, and typically we choose 

!bt
\[
m\approx \sqrt{p}.
\]
!et

In building a random forest, at
each split in the tree, the algorithm is not even allowed to consider
a majority of the available predictors. 

The reason for this is rather clever. Suppose that there is one very
strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other
moderately strong predictors. Then in the collection of bagged
variable importance random forest trees, most or all of the trees will
use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, all of the
bagged trees will look quite similar to each other. Hence the
predictions from the bagged trees will be highly correlated.
Unfortunately, averaging many highly correlated quantities does not
lead to as large of a reduction in variance as averaging many
uncorrelated quantities. In particular, this means that bagging will
not lead to a substantial reduction in variance over a single tree in
this setting.


!split
===== Random Forest Algorithm =====
The algorithm described here can be applied to both classification and regression problems.

We will grow of forest of say $B$ trees.
o For $b=1:B$
  * Draw a bootstrap sample from the training data organized in our $\bm{X}$ matrix.
  * We grow then a random forest tree $T_b$ based on the bootstrapped data by repeating the steps outlined till we reach the maximum node size is reached
    o we select $m \le p$ variables at random from the $p$ predictors/features
    o pick the best split point among the $m$ features using for example the CART algorithm and create a new node
    o split the node into daughter nodes
o Output then the ensemble of trees $\{T_b\}_1^{B}$ and make predictions for either a regression type of problem or a classification type of problem.

Recall that the cumulative gains curve shows the percentage of the
overall number of cases in a given category *gained* by targeting a
percentage of the total number of cases.

Similarly, the receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve,
displays the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its
discrimination threshold is varied. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.

!split
===== Boosting, a Bird's Eye View =====

The basic idea is to combine weak classifiers in order to create a good
classifier. With a weak classifier we often intend a classifier which
produces results which are only slightly better than we would get by
random guesses.

This is done by applying in an iterative way a weak (or a standard
classifier like decision trees) to modify the data. In each iteration
we emphasize those observations which are misclassified by weighting
them with a factor.


!split
===== What is boosting? Additive Modelling/Iterative Fitting =====

Boosting is a way of fitting an additive expansion in a set of
elementary basis functions like for example some simple polynomials.
Assume for example that we have a function
!bt
\[
f_M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_m b(x;\gamma_m),
\]
!et

where $\beta_m$ are the expansion parameters to be determined in a
minimization process and $b(x;\gamma_m)$ are some simple functions of
the multivariable parameter $x$ which is characterized by the
parameters $\gamma_m$.

As an example, consider the Sigmoid function we used in logistic
regression. In that case, we can translate the function
$b(x;\gamma_m)$ into the Sigmoid function


!bt
\[
\sigma(t) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{(-t)}},
\]
!et

where $t=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 x$ and the parameters $\gamma_0$ and
$\gamma_1$ were determined by the Logistic Regression fitting
algorithm.

As another example, consider the cost function we defined for linear regression
!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2.
\]
!et

In this case the function $f(x)$ was replaced by the design matrix
$\bm{X}$ and the unknown linear regression parameters $\bm{\beta}$,
that is $\bm{f}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$. In linear regression we can 
simply invert a matrix and obtain the parameters $\beta$ by

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}=\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

In iterative fitting or additive modeling, we minimize the cost function with respect to the parameters $\beta_m$ and $\gamma_m$.


!split
===== Iterative Fitting, Regression and Squared-error Cost Function =====

The way we proceed is as follows (here we specialize to the squared-error cost function)

o Establish a cost function, here ${\cal C}(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_M(x_i))^2$ with $f_M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_m b(x;\gamma_m)$.
o Initialize with a guess $f_0(x)$. It could be one or even zero or some random numbers.
o For $m=1:M$
  o minimize $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-\beta b(x;\gamma))^2$ wrt $\gamma$ and $\beta$
  o This gives the optimal values $\beta_m$ and $\gamma_m$
  o Determine then the new values $f_m(x)=f_{m-1}(x) +\beta_m b(x;\gamma_m)$

We could use any of the algorithms we have discussed till now. If we
use trees, $\gamma$ parameterizes the split variables and split points
at the internal nodes, and the predictions at the terminal nodes.


!split
===== Squared-Error Example and Iterative Fitting =====

To better understand what happens, let us develop the steps for the iterative fitting using the above squared error function.

For simplicity we assume also that our functions $b(x;\gamma)=1+\gamma x$. 

This means that for every iteration $m$, we need to optimize

!bt
\[
(\beta_m,\gamma_m) = \mathrm{argmin}_{\beta,\lambda}\hspace{0.1cm} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-\beta b(x;\gamma))^2=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-\beta(1+\gamma x_i))^2.
\]
!et

We start our iteration by simply setting $f_0(x)=0$. 
Taking the derivatives  with respect to $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we obtain
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial \beta} = -2\sum_{i}(1+\gamma x_i)(y_i-\beta(1+\gamma x_i))=0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial \gamma} =-2\sum_{i}\beta x_i(y_i-\beta(1+\gamma x_i))=0.
\]
!et
We can then rewrite these equations as (defining $\bm{w}=\bm{e}+\gamma \bm{x})$ with $\bm{e}$ being the unit vector)
!bt
\[
\gamma \bm{w}^T(\bm{y}-\beta\gamma \bm{w})=0,
\]
!et
which gives us $\beta = \bm{w}^T\bm{y}/(\bm{w}^T\bm{w})$. Similarly we have 
!bt
\[
\beta\gamma \bm{x}^T(\bm{y}-\beta(1+\gamma \bm{x}))=0,
\]
!et

which leads to $\gamma =(\bm{x}^T\bm{y}-\beta\bm{x}^T\bm{e})/(\beta\bm{x}^T\bm{x})$.  Inserting
for $\beta$ gives us an equation for $\gamma$. This is a non-linear equation in the unknown $\gamma$ and has to be solved numerically. 

The solution to these two equations gives us in turn $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ leading to the new expression for $f_1(x)$ as
$f_1(x) = \beta_1(1+\gamma_1x)$. Doing this $M$ times results in our final estimate for the function $f$. 



!split
===== Iterative Fitting, Classification and AdaBoost =====

Let us consider a binary classification problem with two outcomes $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ and $i=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$ as our set of
observations. We define a classification function $G(x)$ which produces a prediction taking one or the other of the two values 
$\{-1,1\}$.

The error rate of the training sample is then

!bt
\[
\mathrm{\overline{err}}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} I(y_i\ne G(x_i)). 
\]
!et

The iterative procedure starts with defining a weak classifier whose
error rate is barely better than random guessing.  The iterative
procedure in boosting is to sequentially apply a  weak
classification algorithm to repeatedly modified versions of the data
producing a sequence of weak classifiers $G_m(x)$.

Here we will express our  function $f(x)$ in terms of $G(x)$. That is
!bt
\[
f_M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_m b(x;\gamma_m),
\]
!et
will be a function of 
!bt
\[
G_M(x) = \mathrm{sign} \sum_{i=1}^M \alpha_m G_m(x).
\]
!et



!split
===== Adaptive Boosting, AdaBoost =====

In our iterative procedure we define thus
!bt
\[
f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x)+\beta_mG_m(x).
\]
!et

The simplest possible cost function which leads (also simple from a computational point of view) to the AdaBoost algorithm is the
exponential cost/loss function defined as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\exp{(-y_i(f_{m-1}(x_i)+\beta G(x_i))}.
\]
!et

We optimize $\beta$ and $G$ for each value of $m=1:M$ as we did in the regression case.
This is normally done in two steps. Let us however first rewrite the cost function as 

!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^{m}\exp{(-y_i\beta G(x_i))},
\]
!et
where we have defined $w_i^m= \exp{(-y_if_{m-1}(x_i))}$.

!split
===== Building up AdaBoost =====

First, for any $\beta > 0$, we optimize $G$ by setting

\[
G_m(x) = \mathrm{sign} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i^m I(y_i \ne G_(x_i)),
\]
!et
which is the classifier that minimizes the weighted error rate in predicting $y$.

We can do this by rewriting
!bt
\[
\exp{-(\beta)}\sum_{y_i=G(x_i)}w_i^m+\exp{(\beta)}\sum_{y_i\ne G(x_i)}w_i^m,
\]
!et
which can be rewritten as
!bt
\[
(\exp{(\beta)}-\exp{-(\beta)})\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^mI(y_i\ne G(x_i))+\exp{(-\beta)}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^m=0,
\]
!et
which leads to
!bt
\[
\beta_m = \frac{1}{2}\log{\frac{1-\mathrm{\overline{err}}}{\mathrm{\overline{err}}}},
\]
!et
where we have redefined the error as 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m=\frac{1}{n}\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^mI(y_i\ne G(x_i)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^m},
\]
!et
which leads to an update of
!bt
\[
f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) +\beta_m G_m(x).
\]
!et
This leads to the new weights
!bt
\[
w_i^{m+1} = w_i^m \exp{(-y_i\beta_m G_m(x_i))}
\]
!et

===== Adaptive boosting: AdaBoost, Basic Algorithm =====

The algorithm here is rather straightforward. Assume that our weak
classifier is a decision tree and we consider a binary set of outputs
with $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ and $i=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$ as our set of
observations. Our design matrix is given in terms of the
feature/predictor vectors
$\bm{X}=[\bm{x}_0\bm{x}_1\dots\bm{x}_{p-1}]$. Finally, we define also a
classifier determined by our data via a function $G(x)$. This function tells us how well we are able to classify our outputs/targets $\bm{y}$. 

We have already defined the misclassification error $\mathrm{err}$ as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}I(y_i\ne G(x_i)),
\]
!et
where the function $I()$ is one if we misclassify and zero if we classify correctly. 

!split
===== Basic Steps of AdaBoost =====

With the above definitions we are now ready to set up the algorithm for AdaBoost.
The basic idea is to set up weights which will be used to scale the correctly classified and the misclassified cases.
o We start by initializing all weights to $w_i = 1/n$, with $i=0,1,2,\dots n-1$. It is easy to see that we must have $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i = 1$.
o We rewrite the misclassification error as 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^m I(y_i\ne G(x_i))}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i},
\]
!et
o Then we start looping over all attempts at classifying, namely we start an iterative process for $m=1:M$, where $M$ is the final number of classifications. Our given classifier could for example be a plain decision tree.
  o Fit then a given classifier to the training set using the weights $w_i$.
  o Compute then $\mathrm{err}$ and figure out which events are classified properly and which are classified wrongly.
  o Define a quantity $\alpha_{m} = \log{(1-\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m)/\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m}$
  o Set the new weights to $w_i = w_i\times \exp{(\alpha_m I(y_i\ne G(x_i)}$.
o Compute the new classifier $G(x)= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_m I(y_i\ne G(x_i)$.

For the iterations with $m \le 2$ the weights are modified
individually at each steps. The observations which were misclassified
at iteration $m-1$ have a weight which is larger than those which were
classified properly. As this proceeds, the observations which were
difficult to classifiy correctly are given a larger influence. Each
new classification step $m$ is then forced to concentrate on those
observations that are missed in the previous iterations.

===== Gradient boosting: Basics with Steepest Descent/Functional Gradient Descent =====

Gradient boosting is again a similar technique to Adaptive boosting,
it combines so-called weak classifiers or regressors into a strong
method via a series of iterations.

In order to understand the method, let us illustrate its basics by
bringing back the essential steps in linear regression, where our cost
function was the least squares function.

!split
===== The Squared-Error again! Steepest Descent =====

We start again with our cost function ${\cal C}(\bm{y}m\bm{f})=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{\cal L}(y_i, f(x_i))$ where we want to minimize
This means that for every iteration, we need to optimize

!bt
\[
(\hat{\bm{f}}) = \mathrm{argmin}_{\bm{f}}\hspace{0.1cm} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2.
\]
!et

We define a real function $h_m(x)$ that defines our final function $f_M(x)$ as
!bt
\[
f_M(x) = \sum_{m=0}^M h_m(x).
\]
!et

In the steepest decent approach we approximate $h_m(x) = -\rho_m g_m(x)$, where $\rho_m$ is a scalar and $g_m(x)$ the gradient defined as
!bt
\[
g_m(x_i) = \left[ \frac{\partial {\cal L}(y_i, f(x_i))}{\partial f(x_i)}\right]_{f(x_i)=f_{m-1}(x_i)}.
\]
!et

With the new gradient we can update $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) -\rho_m g_m(x)$. Using the above squared-error function we see that
the gradient is $g_m(x_i) = -2(y_i-f(x_i))$.

Choosing $f_0(x)=0$ we obtain $g_m(x) = -2y_i$ and inserting this into the minimization problem for the cost function we have
!bt
\[
(\rho_1) = \mathrm{argmin}_{\rho}\hspace{0.1cm} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i+2\rho y_i)^2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Steepest Descent Example =====

Optimizing with respect to $\rho$ we obtain (taking the derivative) that $\rho_1 = -1/2$. We have then that
!bt
\[
f_1(x) = f_{0}(x) -\rho_1 g_1(x)=-y_i.
\]
!et
We can then proceed and compute
!bt
\[
g_2(x_i) = \left[ \frac{\partial {\cal L}(y_i, f(x_i))}{\partial f(x_i)}\right]_{f(x_i)=f_{1}(x_i)=y_i}=-4y_i,
\]
!et
and find a new value for $\rho_2=-1/2$ and continue till we have reached $m=M$. We can modify the steepest descent method, or steepest boosting, by introducing what is called _gradient boosting_. 

!split
===== Gradient Boosting, algorithm =====

Steepest descent is however not much used, since it only optimizes $f$ at a fixed set of $n$ points,
so we do not learn a function that can generalize. However, we can modify the algorithm by
fitting a weak learner to approximate the negative gradient signal. 

Suppose we have a cost function $C(f)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}L(y_i, f(x_i))$ where $y_i$ is our target and $f(x_i)$ the function which is meant to model $y_i$. The above cost function could be our standard  squared-error  function
!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f})=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2.
\]
!et

The way we proceed in an iterative fashion is to
o Initialize our estimate $f_0(x)$.
o For $m=1:M$, we
  o compute the negative gradient vector $\bm{u}_m = -\partial C(\bm{y},\bm{f})/\partial \bm{f}(x)$ at $f(x) = f_{m-1}(x)$;
  o fit the so-called base-learner to the negative gradient $h_m(u_m,x)$;
  o update the estimate $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x)+h_m(u_m,x)$;
o The final estimate is then $f_M(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M h_m(u_m,x)$.
