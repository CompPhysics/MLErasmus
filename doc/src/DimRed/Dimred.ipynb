    "## Reducing the number of degrees of freedom, overarching view\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of\n",
    "features for each training instance. Not only does this make training\n",
    "extremely slow, it can also make it much harder to find a good\n",
    "solution, as we will see. This problem is often referred to as the\n",
    "curse of dimensionality.  Fortunately, in real-world problems, it is\n",
    "often possible to reduce the number of features considerably, turning\n",
    "an intractable problem into a tractable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will discuss some of the most popular dimensionality reduction\n",
    "techniques: the principal component analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, and\n",
    "Locally Linear Embedding (LLE).  Furthermore, we will start by looking\n",
    "at some simple preprocessing of the data which allow us to rescale the\n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis and its various variants deal with the\n",
    "problem of fitting a low-dimensional [affine\n",
    "subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space) to a set of of\n",
    "data points in a high-dimensional space. With its family of methods it\n",
    "is one of the most used tools in data modeling, compression and\n",
    "visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed however, we will discuss how to preprocess our\n",
    "data. Till now and in connection with our previous examples we have\n",
    "not met so many cases where we are too sensitive to the scaling of our\n",
    "data. Normally the data may need a rescaling and/or may be sensitive\n",
    "to extreme values. Scaling the data renders our inputs much more\n",
    "suitable for the algorithms we want to employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn** has several functions which allow us to rescale the\n",
    "data, normally resulting in much better results in terms of various\n",
    "accuracy scores.  The **StandardScaler** function in **Scikit-Learn**\n",
    "ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is\n",
    "zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature\n",
    "matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that\n",
    "we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another\n",
    "function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which\n",
    "ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The\n",
    "\n",
    "## More preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normalizer** scales each data\n",
    "point such that the feature vector has a euclidean length of one. In other words, it\n",
    "projects a data point on the circle (or sphere in the case of higher dimensions) with a\n",
    "radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the\n",
    "inverse of itâ€™s length).\n",
    "This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,\n",
    "not the length of the feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RobustScaler** works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it\n",
    "ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that\n",
    "they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median\n",
    "and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the\n",
    "RobustScaler ignore data points that are very different from the rest\n",
    "(like measurement errors). These odd data points are also called\n",
    "outliers, and might often lead to trouble for other scaling\n",
    "techniques.\n",
