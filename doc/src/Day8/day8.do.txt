===== Convolutional Neural Networks (recognizing images) =====


Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last
decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition
tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success
of deep learning methods. The success in for example image
classifications have made them a central tool for most machine
learning practitioners.

CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and
biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and
optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still
expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image
pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a
loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer
and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural
Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).

What is the difference? _CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that
the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties
into the architecture. These then make the forward function more
efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in
the network._

Here we provide only a superficial overview, for the more interested, we recommend highly the course
"IN5400 – Machine Learning for Image Analysis":"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/index-eng.html"
and the slides of "CS231":"http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/".

Another good read is the article here URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf". 




!split
===== Neural Networks vs CNNs =====

Neural networks are defined as _affine transformations_, that is 
a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an
output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result
through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an
image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their
dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector
before the transformation.


!split
===== Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc? =====

However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic
structure. More formally, they share these important properties:
* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .
* They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).
* One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).

These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in
fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information
is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of
the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and
speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is
where discrete convolutions come into play.

A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of
ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output
unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations
in the input).




!split
===== Regular NNs don’t scale well to full images =====

As an example, consider
an image of size $32\times 32\times 3$ (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a
single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular
Neural Network would have $32\times 32\times 3 = 3072$ weights. This amount still
seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not
scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable
size, say $200\times 200\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have 
$200\times 200\times 3 = 120,000$ weights. 

We could have
several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,
this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters
would quickly lead to possible overfitting.

!split
===== 3D volumes of neurons ===== 

Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the
input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more
sensible way. 

In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the
layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width,
height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third
dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural
Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.)

To understand it better, the above example of an image 
with an input volume of
activations has dimensions $32\times 32\times 3$ (width, height,
depth respectively). 

The neurons in a layer will
only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of
all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final
output layer could  for this specific image have dimensions $1\times 1 \times 10$, 
because by the
end of the CNN architecture we will reduce the full image into a
single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth
dimension. 

FIGURE: [figslides/cnn.jpeg, width=500 frac=0.6]  A CNN arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a CNN transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels).



!split 
===== Layers used to build CNNs =====


A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN
transforms one volume of activations to another through a
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build
CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and
Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We
will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.

A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:

* _INPUT_ ($32\times 32 \times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.
* _CONV_ (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\times 32\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.
* _RELU_ layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\times 32\times 12]$).
* _POOL_ (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\times 16\times 12]$.
* _FC_ (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\times 1\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.


!split
===== Transforming images =====

CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original
pixel values to the final class scores. 

Observe that some layers contain
parameters and other don’t. In particular, the CNN layers perform
transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the
input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of
the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a
fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained
with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes
are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.


!split
===== CNNs in brief =====

In summary:

* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)
* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)
* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function
* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)
* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)

and the slides of "CS231":"http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/" which is taught at Stanford University (consistently ranked as one of the top computer science programs in the world). "Michael Nielsen's book is a must read, in particular chapter 6 which deals with CNNs":"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap6.html".



!split
===== CNNs in more detail, building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras =====

  
As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs
to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images
grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  
  
As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks
are the _convolutional_ and _pooling_ layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.
In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D
matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). 


!split
===== Setting it up =====

It means that to represent the entire
dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or _tensor_. This tensor has the dimensions:  
!bt
\[  
(n_{inputs},\, n_{pixels, width},\, n_{pixels, height},\, depth) .
\]
!et
  
!split
=====  The MNIST dataset again =====

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with a pixel size of
$28\times 28$, meaning we require $28 \times 28 = 724$ weights to each
neuron in the first hidden layer.

If we were to analyze images of size $128\times 128$ we would require
$128 \times 128 = 16384$ weights to each neuron. Even worse if we were
dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix
of size $128\times 128$ for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),
meaning 3 times the number of weights $= 49152$ are required for every
single neuron in the first hidden layer.
  

!split
===== Strong correlations =====

Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small
part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for
example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a
small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.

Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the
first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural
networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the
image (in all 3 RGB depth dimensions).  The size of each small area is
fixed, and known as a "receptive":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field".
  

!split 
===== Layers of a CNN =====
The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  
The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3. 

A _convolution_ is performed on the image which outputs
a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as _filters_.


Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product
between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth
dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,
typically the _Rectified Linear (ReLu)_ function, which serves as the
activation of the neurons in the first convolutional layer. This is
further passed through a _pooling layer_, which reduces the size of the
convolutional layer, e.g. by taking the maximum or average across some
small regions, and this serves as input to the next convolutional
layer.


!split
===== Systematic reduction =====  

By systematically reducing the size of the input volume, through
convolution and pooling, the network should create representations of
small parts of the input, and then from them assemble representations
of larger areas.  The final pooling layer is flattened to serve as
input to a hidden layer, such that each neuron in the final pooling
layer is connected to every single neuron in the hidden layer. This
then serves as input to the output layer, e.g. a softmax output for
classification.

!split
===== Set up  the model =====

The 6 lines of code below define the convolutional base using a common pattern: a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.

As input, a CNN takes tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, color_channels), ignoring the batch size. If you are new to these dimensions, color_channels refers to (R,G,B). In this example, you will configure our CNN to process inputs of shape (32, 32, 3), which is the format of CIFAR images. You can do this by passing the argument input_shape to our first layer.

!bc pycod
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

# Let's display the architecture of our model so far.

model.summary()
!ec

You can see that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of output channels for each Conv2D layer is controlled by the first argument (e.g., 32 or 64). Typically, as the width and height shrink, you can afford (computationally) to add more output channels in each Conv2D layer.




!split
===== Add Dense layers on top =====

To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the
convolutional base (of shape (4, 4, 64)) into one or more Dense layers
to perform classification. Dense layers take vectors as input (which
are 1D), while the current output is a 3D tensor. First, you will
flatten (or unroll) the 3D output to 1D, then add one or more Dense
layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so you use a final Dense
layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation.

!bc pycod
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10))
Here's the complete architecture of our model.

===== Recurrent neural networks: Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

=====  An extrapolation example =====

The following code provides an example of how recurrent neural
networks can be used to extrapolate to unknown values of physics data
sets.  Specifically, the data sets used in this program come from
a quantum mechanical many-body calculation of energies as functions of the number of particles.

===== Formatting the Data =====

The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program
differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.
Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the
relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the
recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship
in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is
typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any
extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of
extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting
does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.

For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the
form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a
y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x
values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this
application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values
of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine
learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the
recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the
form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning
the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y
data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region
stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training
region, this method of training can produce accurate extrapolations to
y values far removed from the training data set.


# 
# The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html).
# 
# The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the "x data" are of the form (y1, y2) and the "y data" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow.
# 
# Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points.

===== Other Things to Try =====


Changing the size of the recurrent neural network and its parameters
can drastically change the results you get from the model.  The below
code takes the simple recurrent neural network from above and adds a
second hidden layer, changes the number of neurons in the hidden
layer, and explicitly declares the activation function of the hidden
layers to be a sigmoid function.  The loss function and optimizer can
also be changed but are kept the same as the above network.  These
parameters can be tuned to provide the optimal result from the
network.  For some ideas on how to improve the performance of a

===== Other Types of Recurrent Neural Networks =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".

The first network created below is similar to the previous network,
but it replaces the SimpleRNN layers with LSTM layers.  The second
network below has two hidden layers made up of GRUs, which are
preceeded by two dense (feeddorward) neural network layers.  These
dense layers "preprocess" the data before it reaches the recurrent
layers.  This architecture has been shown to improve the performance
of recurrent neural networks (see the link above and also
URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02857.pdf".

===== Decision trees, overarching aims  =====


We start here with the most basic algorithm, the so-called decision
tree. With this basic algorithm we can in turn build more complex
networks, spanning from homogeneous and heterogenous forests (bagging,
random forests and more) to one of the most popular supervised
algorithms nowadays, the extreme gradient boosting, or just
XGBoost. But let us start with the simplest possible ingredient.

Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms used for both,
classification and regression tasks.


The main idea of decision trees
is to find those descriptive features which contain the most
_information_ regarding the target feature and then split the dataset
along the values of these features such that the target feature values
for the resulting underlying datasets are as pure as possible.

The descriptive features which reproduce best the target/output features are normally  said
to be the most informative ones. The process of finding the _most
informative_ feature is done until we accomplish a stopping criteria
where we then finally end up in so called _leaf nodes_. 

!split
===== Basics of a tree =====

A decision tree is typically divided into a _root node_, the _interior nodes_,
and the final _leaf nodes_ or just _leaves_. These entities are then connected by so-called _branches_.

The leaf nodes
contain the predictions we will make for new query instances presented
to our trained model. This is possible since the model has 
learned the underlying structure of the training data and hence can,
given some assumptions, make predictions about the target feature value
(class) of unseen query instances.

===== A typical Decision Tree with its pertinent Jargon, Classification Problem =====

FIGURE: [DataFiles/cancer.png, width=600 frac=0.8]

This tree was produced using the Wisconsin cancer data (discussed here as well, see code examples below) using _Scikit-Learn_'s decision tree classifier. Here we have used the so-called _gini_ index (see below) to split the various branches.



!split
===== General Features =====

The overarching approach to decision trees is a top-down approach.

* A leaf provides the classification of a given instance.
* A node specifies a test of some attribute of the instance.
* A branch corresponds to a possible values of an attribute.
* An instance is classified by starting at the root node of the tree, testing the attribute specified by this node, then moving down the tree branch corresponding to the value of the attribute in the given example.


This process is then repeated for the subtree rooted at the new
node.


!split
===== How do we set it up? =====


In simplified terms, the process of training a decision tree and
predicting the target features of query instances is as follows:

o Present a dataset containing of a number of training instances characterized by a number of descriptive features and a target feature

o Train the decision tree model by continuously splitting the target feature along the values of the descriptive features using a measure of information gain during the training process

o Grow the tree until we accomplish a stopping criteria create leaf nodes which represent the *predictions* we want to make for new query instances

o Show query instances to the tree and run down the tree until we arrive at leaf nodes

Then we are essentially done!

!split
===== Building a tree, regression =====

There are mainly two steps
o We split the predictor space (the set of possible values $x_1,x_2,\dots, x_p$) into $J$ distinct and non-non-overlapping regions, $R_1,R_2,\dots,R_J$.  
o For every observation that falls into the region $R_j$ , we make the same prediction, which is simply the mean of the response values for the training observations in $R_j$.

How do we construct the regions $R_1,\dots,R_J$?  In theory, the
regions could have any shape. However, we choose to divide the
predictor space into high-dimensional rectangles, or boxes, for
simplicity and for ease of interpretation of the resulting predictive
model. The goal is to find boxes $R_1,\dots,R_J$ that minimize the
MSE, given by

!bt
\[
\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{i\in R_j}(y_i-\overline{y}_{R_j})^2,
\]
!et

where $\overline{y}_{R_j}$  is the mean response for the training observations 
within box $j$. 

!split
===== A top-down approach, recursive binary splitting =====

Unfortunately, it is computationally infeasible to consider every
possible partition of the feature space into $J$ boxes.  The common
strategy is to take a top-down approach

The approach is top-down because it begins at the top of the tree (all
observations belong to a single region) and then successively splits
the predictor space; each split is indicated via two new branches
further down on the tree. It is greedy because at each step of the
tree-building process, the best split is made at that particular step,
rather than looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a
better tree in some future step.

!split
===== Making a tree =====

In order to implement the recursive binary splitting we start by selecting
the predictor $x_j$ and a cutpoint $s$ that splits the predictor space into two regions $R_1$ and $R_2$
!bt
\[
\left\{X\vert x_j < s\right\},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\left\{X\vert x_j \geq s\right\},
\]
!et
so that we obtain the lowest MSE, that is
!bt
\[
\sum_{i:x_i\in R_j}(y_i-\overline{y}_{R_1})^2+\sum_{i:x_i\in R_2}(y_i-\overline{y}_{R_2})^2,
\]
!et

which we want to minimize by considering all predictors
$x_1,x_2,\dots,x_p$.  We consider also all possible values of $s$ for
each predictor. These values could be determined by randomly assigned
numbers or by starting at the midpoint and then proceed till we find
an optimal value.

For any $j$ and $s$, we define the pair of half-planes where
$\overline{y}_{R_1}$ is the mean response for the training
observations in $R_1(j,s)$, and $\overline{y}_{R_2}$ is the mean
response for the training observations in $R_2(j,s)$.

Finding the values of $j$ and $s$ that minimize the above equation can be
done quite quickly, especially when the number of features $p$ is not
too large.

Next, we repeat the process, looking
for the best predictor and best cutpoint in order to split the data
further so as to minimize the MSE within each of the resulting
regions. However, this time, instead of splitting the entire predictor
space, we split one of the two previously identified regions. We now
have three regions. Again, we look to split one of these three regions
further, so as to minimize the MSE. The process continues until a
stopping criterion is reached; for instance, we may continue until no
region contains more than five observations.

!split 
===== Pruning the tree =====

The above procedure is rather straightforward, but leads often to
overfitting and unnecessarily large and complicated trees. The basic
idea is to grow a large tree $T_0$ and then prune it back in order to
obtain a subtree. A smaller tree with fewer splits (fewer regions) can
lead to smaller variance and better interpretation at the cost of a
little more bias.

The so-called Cost complexity pruning algorithm gives us a
way to do just this. Rather than considering every possible subtree,
we consider a sequence of trees indexed by a nonnegative tuning
parameter $\alpha$.

Read more at the following "Scikit-Learn link on pruning":"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_cost_complexity_pruning.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-tree-plot-cost-complexity-pruning-py".

!split
===== Cost complexity pruning =====

For each value of $\alpha$  there corresponds a subtree $T \in T_0$ such that
!bt
\[
\sum_{m=1}^{\overline{T}}\sum_{i:x_i\in R_m}(y_i-\overline{y}_{R_m})^2+\alpha\overline{T},
\]
!et
is as small as possible. Here $\overline{T}$ is 
the number of terminal nodes of the tree $T$ , $R_m$ is the
rectangle (i.e. the subset of predictor space)  corresponding to the $m$-th terminal node.

The tuning parameter $\alpha$ controls a trade-off between the subtree’s
complexity and its fit to the training data. When $\alpha = 0$, then the
subtree $T$ will simply equal $T_0$, 
because then the above equation just measures the
training error. 
However, as $\alpha$ increases, there is a price to pay for
having a tree with many terminal nodes. The above equation will
tend to be minimized for a smaller subtree. 


It turns out that as we increase $\alpha$ from zero
branches get pruned from the tree in a nested and predictable fashion,
so obtaining the whole sequence of subtrees as a function of $\alpha$ is
easy. We can select a value of $\alpha$ using a validation set or using
cross-validation. We then return to the full data set and obtain the
subtree corresponding to $\alpha$. 


!split
===== Schematic Regression Procedure =====

!bblock Building a Regression Tree

o Use recursive binary splitting to grow a large tree on the training data, stopping only when each terminal node has fewer than some minimum number of observations.
o Apply cost complexity pruning to the large tree in order to obtain a sequence of best subtrees, as a function of $\alpha$.
o Use for example $K$-fold cross-validation to choose $\alpha$. Divide the training observations into $K$ folds. For each $k=1,2,\dots,K$ we: 
  * repeat steps 1 and 2 on all but the $k$-th fold of the training data. 
  * Then we valuate the mean squared prediction error on the data in the left-out $k$-th fold, as a function of $\alpha$.
  * Finally  we average the results for each value of $\alpha$, and pick $\alpha$ to minimize the average error.
o Return the subtree from Step 2 that corresponds to the chosen value of $\alpha$. 
!eblock


!split
===== A Classification Tree =====

A classification tree is very similar to a regression tree, except
that it is used to predict a qualitative response rather than a
quantitative one. Recall that for a regression tree, the predicted
response for an observation is given by the mean response of the
training observations that belong to the same terminal node. In
contrast, for a classification tree, we predict that each observation
belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations
in the region to which it belongs. In interpreting the results of a
classification tree, we are often interested not only in the class
prediction corresponding to a particular terminal node region, but
also in the class proportions among the training observations that
fall into that region.  

!split
===== Growing a classification tree =====

The task of growing a
classification tree is quite similar to the task of growing a
regression tree. Just as in the regression setting, we use recursive
binary splitting to grow a classification tree. However, in the
classification setting, the MSE cannot be used as a criterion for making
the binary splits.  A natural alternative to MSE is the _classification
error rate_. Since we plan to assign an observation in a given region
to the most commonly occurring error rate class of training
observations in that region, the classification error rate is simply
the fraction of the training observations in that region that do not
belong to the most common class. 

When building a classification tree, either the Gini index or the
entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular
split, since these two approaches are more sensitive to node purity
than is the classification error rate. 


!split
===== Classification tree, how to split nodes =====

If our targets are the outcome of a classification process that takes
for example $k=1,2,\dots,K$ values, the only thing we need to think of
is to set up the splitting criteria for each node.

We define a PDF $p_{mk}$ that represents the number of observations of
a class $k$ in a region $R_m$ with $N_m$ observations. We represent
this likelihood function in terms of the proportion $I(y_i=k)$ of
observations of this class in the region $R_m$ as

!bt
\[
p_{mk} = \frac{1}{N_m}\sum_{x_i\in R_m}I(y_i=k).
\]
!et 

We let $p_{mk}$ represent the majority class of observations in region
$m$. The three most common ways of splitting a node are given by

* Misclassification error 
!bt
\[
p_{mk} = \frac{1}{N_m}\sum_{x_i\in R_m}I(y_i\ne k) = 1-p_{mk}.
\]
!et 
* Gini index $g$
!bt
\[
g = \sum_{k=1}^K p_{mk}(1-p_{mk}).
\]
!et 
* Information entropy or just entropy $s$
!bt
\[
s = -\sum_{k=1}^K p_{mk}\log{p_{mk}}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Algorithms for Setting up Decision Trees =====

Two algorithms stand out in the set up of decision trees:
o The CART (Classification And Regression Tree) algorithm for both classification and regression
o The ID3 algorithm based on the computation of the information gain for classification

We discuss both algorithms with applications here. The popular library
_Scikit-Learn_ uses the CART algorithm. For classification problems
you can use either the _gini_ index or the _entropy_ to split a tree
in two branches.

!split
===== The CART algorithm for Classification =====

For classification, the CART algorithm splits the data set in two subsets using a single feature $k$ and a threshold $t_k$.
This could be for example a threshold set by a number below a certain circumference of a malign tumor.

How do we find these two quantities?
We search for the pair $(k,t_k)$ that produces the purest subset using for example the _gini_ factor $G$.
The cost function it tries to minimize is then
!bt
\[
C(k,t_k) = \frac{m_{\mathrm{left}}}{m}G_{\mathrm{left}}+ \frac{m_{\mathrm{right}}}{m}G_{\mathrm{right}},
\]
!et
where $G_{\mathrm{left/right}}$ measures the impurity of the left/right subset  and $m_{\mathrm{left/right}}$
 is the number of instances in the left/right subset

Once it has successfully split the training set in two, it splits the subsets using the same logic, then the subsubsets
and so on, recursively. It stops recursing once it reaches the maximum depth (defined by the
$max\_depth$ hyperparameter), or if it cannot find a split that will reduce impurity. A few other
hyperparameters control additional stopping conditions such as the $min\_samples\_split$,
$min\_samples\_leaf$, $min\_weight\_fraction\_leaf$, and $max\_leaf\_nodes$.

!split
===== The CART algorithm for Regression =====

The CART algorithm for regression works is similar to the one for classification except that instead of trying to split the
training set in a way that minimizes say the _gini_ or _entropy_ impurity, it now tries to split the training set in a way that minimizes our well-known mean-squared error (MSE). The cost function is now
!bt
\[
C(k,t_k) = \frac{m_{\mathrm{left}}}{m}\mathrm{MSE}_{\mathrm{left}}+ \frac{m_{\mathrm{right}}}{m}\mathrm{MSE}_{\mathrm{right}}.
\]
!et
Here the MSE for a specific node is defined as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{MSE}_{\mathrm{node}}=\frac{1}{m_\mathrm{node}}\sum_{i\in \mathrm{node}}(\overline{y}_{\mathrm{node}}-y_i)^2,
\]
!et
with
!bt
\[
\overline{y}_{\mathrm{node}}=\frac{1}{m_\mathrm{node}}\sum_{i\in \mathrm{node}}y_i,
\]
!et
the mean value of all observations in a specific node.

Without any regularization, the regression task for decision trees, 
just like for classification tasks, is  prone to overfitting.

===== Pros and cons of trees, pros =====

* White box, easy to interpret model. Some people believe that decision trees more closely mirror human decision-making than do the regression and classification approaches discussed earlier (think of support vector machines)
* Trees are very easy to explain to people. In fact, they are even easier to explain than linear regression!
* No feature normalization needed
* Tree models can handle both continuous and categorical data (Classification and Regression Trees)
* Can model nonlinear relationships
* Can model interactions between the different descriptive features
* Trees can be displayed graphically, and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert (especially if they are small)


!split
===== Disadvantages =====

* Unfortunately, trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches
* If continuous features are used the tree may become quite large and hence less interpretable
* Decision trees are prone to overfit the training data and hence do not well generalize the data if no stopping criteria or improvements like pruning, boosting or bagging are implemented
* Small changes in the data may lead to a completely different tree. This issue can be addressed by using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting or random forests
* Unbalanced datasets where some target feature values occur much more frequently than others may lead to biased trees since the frequently occurring feature values are preferred over the less frequently occurring ones. 
* If the number of features is relatively large (high dimensional) and the number of instances is relatively low, the tree might overfit the data
* Features with many levels may be preferred over features with less levels since for them it is *more easy* to split the dataset such that the sub datasets only contain pure target feature values. This issue can be addressed by preferring for instance the information gain ratio as splitting criteria over information gain

However, by aggregating many decision trees, using methods like
bagging, random forests, and boosting, the predictive performance of
trees can be substantially improved.
